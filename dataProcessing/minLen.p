S"i went out for the evening with my cousin since the place that she had a groupon for was completely slammed last night...  we hemmed, hawed and finally decided on ri ra... \n\nmy experience was solid...  our bartender michael was an absolute delight... he was attentive and offered suggestions...  since i already had dinner for the night, i wasn't very hungry, but i was interested in trying something... i decided on the potato and leek soup, which was incredibly creamy and delicious...  for drinks, i had the jameson rose (which was a vibrant pink... i don't know why that surprised me as much as it did, but it was pretty cool... lol) and a beer flight for $6."

S"oh so my first time here and i was starving upon arrival so i ordered the platter for app and raw filet mignon with quail egg... the platter consisted of fried frog legs, a big crab cake in center, friend shrimp and scallops (i think) it was soo much but i was hungry so as a entree i ordered stuffed lobster which i did not eat all but it was good, i was really stuffed, i can't do all the fried food, it irritates my stomach so the platter wasn't a good choice but if was not nasty, quite good.. i went luton the rooftop where the view was beautiful and they had a zip line there which i didn't get on due to dear if heights but my tummy was satisfied but def over priced in a way"
