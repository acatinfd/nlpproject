S"oh so my first time here and i was starving upon arrival so i ordered the platter for app and raw filet mignon with quail egg... the platter consisted of fried frog legs, a big crab cake in center, friend shrimp and scallops (i think) it was soo much but i was hungry so as a entree i ordered stuffed lobster which i did not eat all but it was good, i was really stuffed, i can't do all the fried food, it irritates my stomach so the platter wasn't a good choice but if was not nasty, quite good.. i went luton the rooftop where the view was beautiful and they had a zip line there which i didn't get on due to dear if heights but my tummy was satisfied but def over priced in a way"
