The basmati rice had good flavor, touch of saffron. I also tried the Masto Khiar which is yogurt cucumber side served with Barbari, Persian flat bread. Simply amazing, I could have eaten it with a spoon, and honestly I did take a couple bites without bread (i couldn't help myself). I had to try the pistachio with saffron and rose water first, it was good, but I have to say other one that had the fresh carrot juice had a more interesting flavor, I could really taste the rose water in it.

The waiter and waitress were extremely friendly and sweet.  We started with their baba ghanoush that was so good I got an extra order to go home.  It came with a great fresh baked flatbread.  For entrees we got their \"bone in chicken kabob\" which was actually a whole cornish game hen cut into pieces, marinated and grill.  Super moist and flavorful.

We walked out very happy.\\n\\nAlso they have fresh juices that they juice to order.  I got the watermelon and the boy got carrot and beet together.  Both were delicious and refreshing.

Most of them are pasable to good. Sometimes you encounter watery hummus, canned dolma, etc...I have a few goto places so far. That is until I went to Zaytoon. Wow. First, even though I have been forgoing bread, the fresh grilled/baked bread they brought out was amazing, I had to try it. Fantastic. Fresh, hot, steamy, crunchy, chewy, yum. The hummus was rich and creamy, the baba ganoush was garlicky, creamy, and tasty, the dolma were warm and fresh. Wow. I think we ordered half the appetizers. The falafel were hot, crunchy, and so savory. What really wowed me was the chicken kabob and the steak \"kabob\" (I do not remember the exact name, it was less of a kabob and more of a strip of thin steak on a skewer). They were both so flavorful, juicy, and fresh. I am getting hungry just remembering it. Also, the rice was tasty, and they had these currants (or some other red berry) that came on the dolma and we could have gotten on the rice that was sweet and delicious without being cloying at all.

After seasoning and marinating for a few hours, the meat is squeezed on a skewer to be cooked over a coal grill or in a clay oven (more traditional style). \\n\\nServed nice and hot. Perfect bite sizes if you cut it where it \"dips\" (refer to picture), The Koobideh kabab is super moist and flavorful. Any residual sauce that may come from the kabab will be easily absorbed by the basmati rice. The rice is nice and fluffy. Add a little butter to it when its nice and hot, and it becomes delicious ! \\n\\nThe grilled tomato adds a nice, refreshing touch to it all. Just an ordinary grilled tomato but it just brightens up everything if you slice off a piece and eat it during the meal. \\n\\nOverall, great experience as usual.

      "('~~~~UPDATE~~~~\\nWe went back to Breadfruit last night, and I must revise my original review to reflect our experience, which deserved more stars.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at 7pm on Saturday night, the place was packed.  There wasn\\'t enough room to push two tables together in order to accommodate our party of 4, so we walked around the block until some tables were open.  The waitress was extremely nice and we were seated about 20 minutes later.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains.  Despite being small portions, they were both very good.  I was inspired to go get some plantains in the Asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home.\\n\\nAs an entree, I ordered the curried tofu again.  I wanted to try something else (the Ital soup or the veggie patty), but they were out of a vital component of each dish, and they don\\'t make the soup in the summer.\\n\\nWhen my entree came out, I was initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken, again.  I asked the waitress and she assured me that what I was seeing was actually a soy product and I had nothing to worry about.  I must say, it was disturbingly, uncomfortably meat-like.  So much so that I made my husband try it and tell me that it was in fact non-meat before I would put it in my mouth.  When I did eat it, it even had the texture of meat - very disconcerting.  The flavor was excellent, and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog.  The sides were good (definitely better flavor since last time), especially mixed with the curry sauce.\\n\\nI have to issue a heartfelt apology to Wayne and The Breadfruit for the disparaging review that I wrote after my last visit.  I should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish was, in fact, fake meat.  It has been so long since I ate chicken (and I don\\'t generally eat fake meat), that I truly thought it was meat.  (Lesson:  Don\\'t assume anything!)\\n\\nMy dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish, and all enjoyed them thoroughly.  I tried the festivals (breadstick) from someone\\'s meal, and I have to say that Breadfruit should offer a basket of those as an appetizer.  Yum.\\n\\nWhen we were almost finished with our meal, the waitress brought us full sized samples of the carrot juice.  Another Yum!  It tasted a lot like Thai Iced tea - similar seasonings, and very rich and creamy.  \\n\\nI will definitely go back to Breadfruit.  The food was good (Festivals=crack), the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT, and it is close to home.  \\n\\nHome Run, Breadfruit.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nDowntown Phoenix NEEDS a Jamaican restaurant (and an Ethiopian, Italian, Mexican, etc), and I have waited anxiously for Breadfruit to open - riding my bike by there every afternoon for weeks looking for any sign of life.  \\n\\nFinally, just this week, I see people eating there.  So, we went for lunch today ( at 12:45... at the end of the lunch rush), of course, we arrived at the exact same moment  as Phil Gordon.   I think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go, but they don\\'t get a by for that.\\n\\nThe wait was long (35 minutes), but they were really busy, and they just opened, and the mayor was there, so it was understandable.  We forgave.  The lone waiter brought me a Fiji water, It tided me over slightly.\\n\\nI was excited to see several \"vegan\" options on the menu - mostly sides, but it looks like some of the entrees can be modified to fit vegetarian requirements.  \\n\\nI ordered the curried tofu (that is the name printed on the menu, no modifications!), which comes with sides of steamed plantains, beans/rice, and steamed cabbage/green bell peppers.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I recieved curried chicken, a fact that I discovered after getting back to my office... and I was WAY too starving to go back to get it fixed.  I ate around the chicken, something I am normally loathe to do... but as I said, STARVING.\\n\\nThe beans and rice = bland.  Nothing spectacular, they were just that: beans and rice.\\n\\nPlantains = undercooked.  Just slightly.  I wanted them to be so much better than they were.\\n\\nCabbage/Green Bell pepper = boring.  They were just steamed cabbage and green pepper.  I love cooked cabbage, but with salt please!\\n\\nNothing that I ate was seasoned at all.  I had bite or two of the curry sauce since it was touching the rice (starving!), and it tasted ok... am I allowed to pass judgement on a sauce that was poured over something I don\\'t ever eat (because I think it is disgusting)?  Its hard to say.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I would have enjoyed this meal A LOT more if I had recieved a meal that did not contain meat.  \\n\\nI will probably go back... Breadfruit is new, and they deserve another chance.  I will definitely eat in, and I will try David\\'s reccomendation of the avocado rolls.\\n\\nOne strike.  They haven\\'t struck out just yet.', 5)\n",
      "(\"Breadfruit is the truth.  \\n\\nThis is corroborated by the fact that Exhibit A, i.e, the Jerk Chicken will make you a believer in a deity, be it God, Buddha, Allah, Brahman, Akal Purakh, Zeus, or Marley.\\n\\nThe bird is marinated in hot and spicy seasonings and finished to perfection on the grill.  It remained tender and juicy throughout, except for the masterfully charred ends that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish.  \\n\\nBut lets back up a second.\\n\\nThe space itself is brilliant in its simplicity.  The walls are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture.  The glassed walls look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown Phoenix and onto the hidden pave of Pierce, an homage to side-street gems that one would find in cities like NY, SF, and Seattle. \\n\\nIt is comfortable and cozy inside, with exposure to the cuisine sharks tending the kitchen.  At all times, there is activity, but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area.  I love restaurants that pull this off.\\n\\nFor an app, we started with an order of the Curry Chicken Patty.  It was sensational.  Within the pastry was a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable, but slight burn throughout.  Two came in an order, which must be shared with a partner because two pre-meal would fill you up too heavily.\\n\\nWhen the grilled jerk chicken was presented, it was glorious because you find the Caribbean influences presented on the dish; a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw, roasted pineapple, and a succulent, savory corncob.  Where the chicken is the heart of the meal, the corn was the soul.  Paired together, I couldn't have been more delighted.\\n\\nTo drink, we had the D&G Spicy Ginger Beer imported from Jamaica.  Erm, I typically like Ginger Beer, but this one was branded as spicy and they f'ing mean it.  Be careful that you are prepared for spice-on-spice if you order it.  Looking back, i probably should have stuck with water, although the Ginger Beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine.  Honestly, I cannot wait to go here to grab a Guinness (a Jamaican staple according to Zane Lamprey) or a Red Stripe.  The surging spiciness demands a brew that could handle this oral development.\\n\\nOverall, I'm very pleased Breadfruit braved the Great Menace that is downtown development.  Here's to them gaining credibility as they continue to master their art (its not perfect yet, but please believe, its in the mail) and invigorate a local following of foodies and tourists alike to sample some mean Caribbean food.\", 5)\n",

Yeah, Jamaican food isn\\'t like a culinary feat, and although I love Cuban food (a cousin to Jamaican food, you could say), I\\'d never ventured to the spicier side of Caribbean cuisine. But, WOW, I\\'m so glad I did!\\n\\nIt was a lovely Friday afternoon, when a work friend suggested we head over to Breadfruit for a long, leisurely lunch. And, I must say Breadfruit was a great antidote to a stressful work week. After waiting just a little too long for our menus, we were greeted by a friendly waiter who gave us some recommendations on drinks. My friend had the carrot-coconut juice -- he loves his carrot juice, so he was thrilled they had it on the menu and loved every sip of it. I, on the other hand, just had their house iced tea. They had a lot of other beverage options, I just wanted to avoid something too sweet. \\n\\nThere was a decent selection of menu choices and everything sounded delicious, so it was tough for me to decided which meal would whet my appetite.  My friend had the jerk chicken, which he said was spicy (of course) but fantastic. I had the brown stew chicken, and in my best Rachel Zoe, it was BA-na-NAs!  The chicken was cooked wonderfully and the flavorful sauce was so complex and delicious my taste buds sang a glorious \"Hallelujah!\" \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to go back and try more from their menu.  I was totally eying the plantain avocado spring rolls -- LOVE plantains and LOVE avocados, so I know I would LOVE this!  And, I was really wanting to try the curried chicken dumplings, but I was afraid if I had that for lunch I would be in a food coma for the rest of the day.\\n\\nYou know a place is good, while during your first visit, you are already planning what your next meal will be!  So for that reason alone, I\\'d say it was another great culinary adventure for me! Yeah!', 5)\n",
      "(\"Cheap! Fresh! Flavorful!\\nThat's the important stuff!\\n\\nI love trying new things and Breadfruit did not disappoint!

      "(\"I had a really disappointing experience with The Breadfruit. \\n\\nIt was a Monday. It was a nice day. We wanted a picnic. We stopped at the Breadfruit to ask if we could get something to go. We were told no.\\n\\nThe woman (owner?) told us repeatedly that they are a dine-IN restaurant, that it meant we can not take our food with us, and that take-out is bad for the environment. She was superior and insulting.\\n\\nMy friend and I both work in restaurants. We are perfectly clear what dine in means. We would have tipped the server. We were flexible. We were hungry. We would have been happy to take our food in tin foil. We would have been happy to bring our own plates to receive the food on. We could have sat down, taken a bite, and asked for doggie bags. We understood that the Breadfruit is a dine-in restaurant, but they could have worked with us. \\n\\nThere was only one occupied table in the place, but she flat out refused to serve us and was rude about it. Unbelievable!\\n\\nI won't be back for dine-in. I won't be back ever.\", 1)\n",

      "(\"There's no point in making a reservation at Breadfruit if they won't honor it.  Or to be more precise, they should be less deceptive about taking your reservation.  In our case, we were given the impression that we'd have to wait about 20 minutes for our little group.  On the phone they did tell us that there was another party ahead of us.  What they didn't tell us was that it would really be more like the 20 minutes times 3 for the four adults and two kiddos.  When we made our way in, the place was half full, but four two-tops were open and a large table for six was reserved.  Not for us, of course, and nobody was leaving anytime soon.\\n\\nWhile we waited, a party of two walked in and was seated.  A few minutes later, another two-top near them turned over.  A little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open tables, and put the other now free tables together.   It would have been a tight fit, but it could have worked.\\n\\nNeedless to say, The Breadfruit is small.  There is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren't going to wait outside in the drizzle.  We waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn't wait anymore.

We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! \\n\\nWhile the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book.

The scallops were cooked just right and were on the money with regard to spice. The spinach patty is such a basic thing, really delicate with some unexpected savory taste. \\n\\nShe had Curried Chicken and Dumpling. Superb. The whole wheat dumpling was unexpected and had a thick bit to it. The go-alongs were cabbage, green banana, and plantains. I got to taste most of it and found it to be  perfect island comfort food. \\n\\nI had the Estovich Fish and Festival. Tonight\\'s fish was red snapper, which I love. They used their Jerk rub to heat it up and put the Estovich on the side. Good move, as you can heat it up Scotch Bonnet-style, as much as you\\'d like.

There were about 20 or so people in the whole place (restaurant and bar), so it didn't seem that busy. However, it took about 10 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order or even acknowledge our group. Not a good sign. \\n\\nAfter we made our order or Estate Mai Tai, Dark and Stormy, Mojito Ponganot and French Caribbean Breeze, two of which were the server/bar keepers suggestions, we waited and checked out the decor. The ambiance inside is dark and relaxed, but made reading the menu almost impossible. Others around us and our group were using cell phones to try and read the menu, it was so dark. I get trying to give a place a vibe, but can we get a little bit of light to read? \\n\\nDrinks Arrive! These were amazing. I had very high expectations given the selection of rum and narrative behind everything we ordered, but was still impressed. Drinks were well blended and decently strong. The Mai Tai was off the charts and might have kicked my ass had I gotten another.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the next drink, that never happened. Our server/bar keep came by mid way through our cocktails and asked if we wanted a second order, but given the time it was taking us to get through the first one, three of us waited and one ordered a Red Stripe.\\n\\n15 minutes pass and most of us are either done or close enough to order another, but no server. Drinks done and our group is waiting for another 10 minutes. No Red Stripe and no second order. What the hell. Now we are sitting around waiting just to see how long it takes, but after 10 more minutes, we give up and go to the bar to get our tab. 10 more minutes go by and we finally have our bill, but there is no breakdown of what we ordered. It's just part of good service to always bring a breakdown of the bill and we were curious to see if the Red Stripe we ordered and never got was on there.  Sure enough, after 10 more minutes of waiting to get a breakdown of the bill, there was the unicorn Red Stripe. Getting that off the bill was another 10 minutes and finally, we were allowed to leave.\\n\\nI'm not sure what happened that evening, but there is no reason for poor service. The place was not that busy and they were clearly not understaffed  based on the amount of staff roaming around. The staff seemed preoccupied with assisting those sitting directly at the bar instead of the lounge seating behind the bar stools and the bar appeared to be getting great service.

Hell, you could easily pass right by it and not even notice its there. But that all adds to the charm of The Breadfruit and makes it seem like its a secret place that only you and whoever you are dining with knows about. Its also a romantic place for a date. The paintings on the wall are for sale. It can get a bit loud when it gets filled only because the place is small. But that's a minor gripe. When my girlfriend and I go she gets the brown stew chicken. I get either the curry chicken and dumplings or the jerk chicken, and I don't even like spicy food that much. But the jerk chicken is so good I love it. quote me on what im about to say. THE BREADFRUIT HAS SOME OF THE BEST AND STRONGEST DRINKS! I love their drinks there because they are never watered down. The first sip of your drink may seem pretty overwhelming. But don't worry, its just the alcohol telling your tastebuds to wake the hell up! The drinks are smooth and very tasty and you just taste a hint of alcohol in the drink even though they put alot in them. Which ive always thought was good when the alcohol doesn't overpower the taste of the drink. The Dark & Stormy regular or the Dark & Stormy 151 are my drink of choice, highly recommend either one of those. One more thing. Whatever you order make sure you get a side of festival bread. I don't care if your meal already comes with it, order a side anyway. Its very delicious bread. A dinner for a couple averages between $40-$60 if u just get dinner and a couple drinks.

I have been a vegetarian since I was 10 and do not like meat at all. I ordered the tofu, but when it came out it looked more like chicken, and the texture was like chicken. I asked my boyfriend to try a piece and he thought it was chicken as well. After several attempts we got the server\\'s attention and asked him if he was sure they made tofu and not chicken by mistake. This is where our serves becomes unbelievable. The guy actually yells at me that \"it is not chicken, it is tempeh not chicken!\" (tempeh is a soy product, but is not tofu. It should not be listed as tofu on the menu) If it had been listed correctly on the menu I would not have ordered it because I already know I do not like it.\\nI did not know how to react. I ended up just eating the rice, and the server ignored us the rest of the meal. He came back to pick up the plates noticing I did not eat it and didn\\'t say a word or offer to take it off the bill.

Big surprise. \\n\\n(If you read other reviews on Yelp, you can read about the pushy service. Just awful.)\\n\\nShe talked at us, and not to us. When we were done ordering, she-- in constant sales mode-- pushed the Rice & Peas, which is Jamaican rice and beans. \\n\\nI love rice & peas, so even though I didn\\'t like our pushy server, I ordered anyway. When the food arrived, my companion and I each took a bite of the rice and-- if I would have had a napkin-- I would have spit it out. \\n\\nThe flavor could only be described as \"odd\"-- and it was served room temperature. We both agreed- independently of one another-- that the rice was inedible. \\n\\nGosh, the way our server upsold us, you would think it would be at least edible. \\n\\nI ordered the soup of the day. I was told it was red snapper with vegetable. It was a fish broth with vegetables. There was no red snapper. So why was \"red snapper\" included in the title of the soup? I have no idea. \\n\\nSo they basically boiled some fish heads, put some veggies in, and made $7.25 profit on a $7.50 soup. I was pissed. \\n\\nOf course, I would have liked to tell our useless server / bartender about this, but she never stopped by to ask us how our meal was-- NOT ONCE. \\n\\nWhen the food was dropped, we ordered another round of drinks and did not get them until our meal was almost finished. \\n\\nThe manager came and cleared our plates, so I told him. He just smiled and basically told me it was my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup. \\n\\nPlaintains were oven-roasted and tasty. Very stingy portion though.

We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.

      "(\"I was in Phoenix for a conference and found The Breadfruit through a web search. It's just a short walk NW of the convention center. The first night I was there I was amazed at the bar's wall full of rum--more than 100 varieties, but more about that later. The dining area was rather small but I was able to get a table during the week (not the same story on a weekend night; reservations are recommended). The waitstaff had spot-on descriptions of the food and cocktails and was passionate about the fare. The menu had quite a lot of seafood options, from mussels to prawns to the catch of the day (red snapper when I visited). The scallops appetizer was delicious--two large, juicy scallops seasoned to perfection. I was glad I took the waiter's recommendation and ordered the prawns; the curry sauce was creamy with a mild flavor. Since I couldn't decide between that or the jerk, I had to come back a couple nights later to try the free range jerk chicken, which was savory and spicy. Both meals were exceptional, and my only regret was that I wasn't in Phoenix longer to try some other dishes. The meals ranged between $14 and $24. Now, back to the rum bar. The bar staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. During my two visits, I tried several of the cocktails and was not disappointed with any. Each drink was made with fresh ingredients and with a variety of rums. You'll not find Captain Morgan or Bacardi here; rather, rums from the Caribbean and Central America dominate, and they even have a rum from Tennessee with a bit of a bourbon taste. You'll also not find whiskey or vodka, just rum, Red Stripe, and wine. They offer some rum flights at a reasonable price, and it's a great opportunity to try different brands of rum and different ages. The owner and bartenders will tell you anything you want to know about the various rums--I felt like I should have been taking notes. I cannot recommend The Breadfruit highly enough and will definitely return again on my next visit to Phoenix. If you're traveling for a convention, steer away from the chain and concept restaurants at CityScape and try this independently owned authentic taste of Jamaica.\", 5)\n",

I'm a vegan so they have one vegetarian option on the menu which I wasn't interested in so I asked if I could create a plate. They said no because theyre flavors were expertly paired and the dishes were already made. Ha! I wondered is it a TV dinner because if not you should have no trouble putting rice and peas, plantains, and greens on a plate. I asked if a watermelon could be put in my mojito they said no like how hard is that. I looked around to see if the business reflected all the no's i was getting and the place was empty. Mind you it was dinner time and its a dinner restaurant. I finally ordered the avocado plantain spring rolls.

We are all working professional women who are accustomed to fine dining and good service, but unfortunately, we got none of that at The Breadfruit. \\n\\nOur waitress tried to push the most expensive thing on the menu multiple times, despite my friends saying they don\\'t like seafood. She then tried to push everyone to order sides of rice and peas (I really wonder if they make a commission from selling rice and peas), and also suggested that my friend order some for her 1-year-old son. My friend went ahead and ordered it because she figured he could nibble on it if he wanted, and it wouldn\\'t be a big waste of money if he didn\\'t like it or wasn\\'t hungry. More on this later...\\n\\nAnother friend asked the waitress if she could get her meal without anything banana-related on the plate, because she has a banana aversion. The waitress extremely rudely replied \"The menu SAYS right THERE that no substitutions are allowed. And they AREN\\'T bananas - they\\'re plantains.\" My friend stated that she couldn\\'t eat either bananas or plantains, and that she wasn\\'t asking for a substitution, but rather the omission of the plantains from the plate. The waitress stated that it could not be done, because it would ruin the presentation of the dish, so I just piped up and told my friend I would take her plantains off the plate. \\n\\nNow back to the rice and peas. When the 1-year-old started eating it, he spilled some of it onto the table, and then wiped what he had spilled from the table onto the floor (he\\'s a 1-year-old, after all! He hadn\\'t made a peep the entire time we were there, nor did he ever try to get down from his adult-sized chair, so pushing some rice onto the floor was not a huge transgression). The waitress immediately came over and said, in the rudest voice ever, \"Oh that\\'s just GREAT. Can you just NOT let him do that???\" to which my friend replied, \"Don\\'t you have a broom? I will clean it up.\" The waitress just rolled her eyes and disappeared (but never did bring a broom). My friends and I are generous tippers, and would have rewarded the waitress greatly for dealing with the aftermath of a toddler\\'s dinner. However, after the rudeness we had experienced up to this point, we couldn\\'t take it any longer. We asked the other waiter to speak to a manager, and after about 5 minutes (during which time our waitress never did reappear), the manager finally came over and spoke to us. He told us that the waiter would be serving us for the rest of our dinner, instead of the waitress, but he never did apologize for his employee\\'s rude behavior. \\n\\nI see from other Yelp reviews that others have had similar experiences with that waitress, and I question if she is still employed solely based on her scallop- and rice-and-pea- upselling abilities. It was clear she wanted to do as little work as possible and clear our table as quickly as possible. \\n\\nIf I had only gone for drinks, I would definitely go back again, but I don\\'t think the food is good enough for me to want to tolerate the utterly crappy service, and I know can get good drinks so many other places.

Again - perfect balance between tart and sweet and the best mojito I have had outside of my secret recipe!\\n\\nFor dessert there was a deep internal struggle between ordering the sweet potato pudding and enjoying another pina colada.  Since I was the driver the puddin won out. It was a unique dessert - not very sweet and nicely complimented by whipped cream flavored with even more rum.   I read a few poor reviews for the size of the desserts - OK people this is not the Claim Jumper.  The size was perfect for sharing and a completely appropriate size for a dessert.

When her order arrived we all agreed that \"lollipops\" was an excellent description because the dish looked exactly like we expected.

Tried the avocado and plantains appetizer which was very unique. Who would think to add these two items together?  Brilliant.  My husband tried the jerk pulled pork and if you like food with a kick, I would try something different and give this a try, as it will give you a kick!  Ended my meal with a butter drink of some sort, which was dessert in liquid form.  A creamy liqueur drink, but well work it.  Left off the sweet potato pudding dessert which also was unique and quite delicious.

Learned about the establishment while researching  suggested restaurants from my companies vendor for a large group coming to town in March. Was told at 6:10pm that there was a two hour wait and that it's best to make a reservation before dining. Well of course I was not going to wait two hours to eat dinner. So we left. Then it hit me, the white couple in front of us that arrived at the same time wasn't leaving nor did they have reservations. Why were they staying and we weren't?!?! So at 6:17pm I called the restaurant from my car to make a 7pm reservation. The same person, Dwayne (who said he was the owner) told me he could accommodate us at 7:30pm. Definitely not two hours. Maybe my voice didn't sound Black like my face looked. What a huge let down!!! I will do my best to spread the word about my unfortunate experience at breadfruit.\", 1)\n",

Once we were seated no one stopped by for over 15 minutes. For anything. Not water, not \"I\\'ll be right with you\", nothing. It was as if we weren\\'t there at all. It was a decent night for them, about half full. On our side (bar) there were two other people sitting at the bench by the window. At one point, two men walked through the bar and attempted to enter the restaurant in order to pass along a message to some friends eating dinner when they were stopped by the host and asked to leave as \"this is a very small establishment and there is no room for you\". The men handled it well, joking after the server walked away that apparently the place was \"at critical mass\".

They told us they would only accommodate groups of 6. \\n\\nthis was a huge pain bc it was an hour before our reservations and people were already on their way. we were able to convince them to reserve a 2nd table next to ours on the patio so we would all fit and be able to sit near each other. Only after they confirmed we\\'d be ordering alcohol in addition to our meals of course. \\n\\nupon arriving we realized we had the whole patio to ourselves and if we pushed the tables together we would all be able to fit comfortably together with room for another table on the patio should they have more diners. \\n\\nwe asked if we could push our tables together and they were very snotty telling us we were basically lucky that they even agreed to accommodate us to begin with and the set up they created was our only option. we should bow down and kiss their feet for taking us at all. \\n\\nlike seriously?! you can\\'t make any exceptions?! it would be one thing for us to suck it up if it clearly wasn\\'t possible but it was totally possible for us all to sit together without changing a dang thing to the outside set up. it doesn\\'t change anything!!!  our group could have sat together for crying out loud. it was totally possible. so stubborn and rude. \\n\\nso that really set the mood for all of us. if we thought someplace nearby could accommodate a group of 10 last minute we would have pimp walked outta there. \\n\\nbut we endured it, tried to get past it for the sake of the meal and enjoyed all of their tasty drinks and the food was good. i loved their pina colada redux. the spring rolls were super boring flavor wise and left me thinking \"what the heck, yelpers?! why did so many people recommend this?\". my jerk chicken was tasty. \\n\\nabout 95% of our group smokes so after the meal they went to the back area to have a smoke(it sounded like they had a nice area just for this). the servers chased everyone down in the smoking area and tried handing them the bill while they were back there enjoying themselves making things really weird. \\n\\nwhile the majority of the group was in the back smoking area they served me a free birthday dessert which was awkward bc shouldn\\'t you do that when the whole party is around? they knew most of my party was out back seeing as how they chased them down with the checks. i blew out the candle and the few of us sitting there tasted it. it was one of the grossest things ever so thankfully it was free. it was a really sweet gesture though (but just fyi...dont order the potato dessert pie or whatever its called. better known as barf pie. i totally understand why they give that one away for free. no one would pay for that. just saying). but still, really kind birthday gesture. *ok, after reading some other reviews you people are loving this sweet potato pie. i am officially convinced they served us a rotten piece on purpose*\\n\\nthey don\\'t usually let people split the check (we noticed this printed at the bottom of the menu) but our nice server offered to let us... only he made us divide everything up for him. i mean, isn\\'t that his job? i get that it isn\\'t normally allowed but he offered and it would have been really nice for him to divide it up for us. plus the restaurant was not busy and we spent a lot of money on food and drinks. it\\'s the least they could have done but they apparently hate accommodating customers or providing an enjoyable dining experience for larger groups. this behavior would be acceptable at applebees or something. ugh whatever we were just so ready to get the heck out of there bc we were so clearly not welcome.\\n\\ni def won\\'t be back and i know most of my party will not be back based on this experience. \\n\\nthis place really is only good for super small, intimate settings. i wouldn\\'t recommend going here with more than 4 people. they make it known that they don\\'t really want you there if there are more than 4 of you anyway so be prepared to have a horrible time if you\\'re with a group.\\n\\nAlso, you can\\'t even order breadfruit at the breadfruit.', 1)\n",

The plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked. The drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of Wray&Nephew. \\n\\nSo as we sat sipping, a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food, we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren\\'t served on the starter menu.

They also have cigar & rum pairings - loved to see Zacapa 23 paired with Arturo Fuente 858 (as a cool feature, you can even bring your own cigar to enjoy!). Finally, there are rum tasting flights.

I've gotten the nutty salad, and the salmon caesar.  All top notch.  This is definitely a quick get in and out and good food to boot whether it's lunch or dinner.\", 5)\n",
      "(\"Jason's Deli is the jam when it comes to fresh sandwiches overflowing meat and toppings.  I'm always blown away by the selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and bread and the combinations that the cheerful staff point clueless folks to.  .\\n\\nVEGETARIANS BEWARE: YOU WILL BE APPALLED BY WHAT I WILL SAY NEXT.  Like Todd W. says, the roast beef sandwich is awesome.  I've had it twice and I can honestly say its the best roast beef sammie I can recall.  It's not like that grey matter they serve at Arby's.  No, its pink at the core, moist and pilled 1-inch thick on bread.  The sides are equally appealing, like the homemade-tasting potato salad.The portions alone make this place stand out-think McAllister's on steroids\\n\\nThe salad bar looked incredibly fresh as well.  In fact, the whole establishment looks fresh.  Yes, you get free muffins and ice cream.  But don't let them spoil your appetite-their sandwiches alone will bust your gut.  For around $8, you will leave Jason's Deli fat and happy.\", 5)\n",

Not only did he not rush me, he made recommendations and even threw in a couple extras. It was a great way to start my trip so if you're in Pineville, NC, go to Jason's Deli and ask for Tim.

I recommend the Zucchini Grillini sandwich, which is as fun to eat as it is to say.  It is layers of zucchini with tomatoes, red onions, black olives and Russian dressing which is the perfect blend of complements on this sandwich.  Enjoy it with the blue corn tortilla chips or a side of fresh fruit.  Don't forget the ice cream machine for your free ice cream afterward.  They have recently redecorated the dining room to give it a more coffeehouse-style feel and it is nice.\", 5)\n",

I do love the instant salad bar line where you can jump the big line and order a salad (plus soup and proteins) on a card-only kiosk. I NEVER wait which is one of the reasons I go to Jason's. The other main reason I go to Jason's is the salad bar. It's always fresh and has some nice extras. The only negatives are that frequently the lettuce is wetter than I like and they put ice down in some of the vegetables which ends up in my salad. Also I miss the cauliflower!\\nMinor details.

N e ways its 2011,and I was asked, if u could eat anything for Yur birthday,what would it be? Without thinking I replied waldos bbq country ribs w/ sauteed house veggies, spicy fries,mustard bbq sauce and a sweet tea. so we found this one on main in mesa,and as u can imagine,I have mixed feelings on my way,I am excited cuz I used to crave and eat this twice a week while I was in college in 03,at the same time its 8 years later and my expectations are thru the roof,becuz I so long to satisfy this longing for this fond memory of great simple bbq,not muddled by trend or times.so finally we get there and I see the pink pig and I smile deep down,we walk in and its the same saw dust on the ground just like i remember,we were seated and they brought out a huge mason jar filled to the threading w/ fresh sweet tea,just like I remember,then they follow w/ complimentary green Chile corn bread and butter,just like I remember,then we order thru our engaging,smiling and menu savvy staff,just like I remember,in the time it takes to eat Yur cornbread,the food arrives,and with all the denile almost gone I taste,and its magic,exactly the same,and I could not believe it,it was like reliving and fond dream. I was reaquanted w/ a love I thought I would never find again. It really was perfect and I want to commend the ownership of waldos and be the first to say thank u. For Yur hard work.it completely shows in where it matters most that u care,in service and most importantly food,thank u so much.

But we still went in...\\n\\nAnd got the worst table in the house.\\n\\nSeriously. The sign above it said so. And promised 20% off for sitting there - and they did take it off the bill as promised!\\n\\nNo sooner did we sit down than a server slid two squares of cornbread and butter at us.  The first bite was just good old-fashioned cornbread. The second bite surprised us with a bit of jalapeno - all I can say is yum.  It was warm, it was fresh, and had enough pepper to add an occasional little burst of flavor, but not enough to overwhelm the cornbread. So far, so good.\\n\\nI decided to order the brisket and DS ordered the sampler with brisket, pulled pork, and ribs.  We both got sweet potato fries and I got fried corn, DS got mac and cheese (hey, he's 20 - he can do that carb overload at his age).\\n\\nThe brisket - what can I say? Nirvana.  It was smokey and juicy.  Enough fat on the edges to tell you that it was the real stuff - and to keep it juicy. Fork tender.  \\n\\nNow they serve the sauce on the side in a skillet. At first, I took a teaspoon of sauce and put it on the meat, then I decided oh hell, I started dipping it, it was that good.  A little vinegary, a little sweet.  Not thick and saucy, more southern and thinner.\\n\\nPulled pork - wow.  Very good.  DS did give me a bite and it was tender, juicy, and smoky.\\n\\nNow - some of you are going to say a little greasy.  there is a fine line there.   If you use a shoulder or butt, yep, you are going to get fat and a little grease.  But man, that makes for good eating.  Leave that Weight Watchers diet guide at home when you come here.\\n\\nRibs - nicely cooked.  A mild rub, not overwhelming. You will definitely want that sauce to add a little kick to those ribs.\\n\\nbtw - we did the original sauce but they also have a jerk sauce, a spicy Louisiana, and a mustard.\\n\\nSweet potato fries were not shoestring, they actually had a little substance to them. Tasty.\\n\\nMac and cheese - not bad.  I tasted a little onion in it I think. Creamy.   I am a really picky mac and cheese eater, so most places don't do much for me.\\n\\nThe last side was the fried corn.  Meh. It didn't do much for me.  It was still on the cob, so it was just too soft for me (I am a 4 minute corn cooker so if you like your corn that firm, this is not the corn for you).\\n\\nInterestingly enough, the sides are endless - although I can't imagine how you would be able to eat everything in one sitting unless you were wearing Joey's turkey-eating pants :)  We brought home almost one entire order of fries between the two of us.\\n\\nAnd the best part? It was reasonably priced - so many restaurants out this way  break the bank but this one didn't.  kudos to Waldo.\\n\\nI would recommend trying Waldo's if you are a real BBQ hound - it will never win any awards for decor but, frankly, when you are busy licking your fingers and smacking your lips, who cares about decor??\", 5)\n",

DH and I both used the coupon on the website for the country ribs and pulled pork, DS took the safe route and ordered a sampler again. \\n\\n I decided to order a tossed as a side - and was I impressed.  We went somewhere earlier in the week and ordered wings and a side salad - and at $4,it had nothing more than some iceberg, croutons, and dressing.  This was a nice salad - thick diagonal slices of cukes, grape tomatoes, croutons and spring mix tossed with the iceberg.  And large.  Between the cornbread and the salad, I was about done in.\\n\\nDH got the cowboy beans.  They were real pintos cooked with chili powder and maybe a little ground meat.  Tasty if you are not the canned pork and beans crowd - but they wouldn't appreciate homemade beans anyway :)  He also had the spiced fries - I haven't figured those out yet.  Not blackened, not chili - just a little itsy bitsy bit of spice on them.  Tasty but I just can't figure out what they had on them.  But they were neither overly-salted or overly-spiced.\\n\\nCountry ribs were plentiful and moist but they should be a fattier cut of pork (and they were).

They have never ending sides (including baked sweet potatoes) which I could eat for days on end anyways and B.) They serve their meat in tiny skillets (which is flipping adorable.)

I am very fond of the fried cat fish, and I lived in the south for a time and can tell you that it's every bit as good as the best in Nashville. \\n\\nThe service is disorganized. They have some stellar wait staff and some children who need more direction than they're getting. This can cause long waits for seating and for service once seated.

I got Mac and cheese and she got fries. She didn't like the fries, and I didn't like the Mac and cheese. We switched and each loved it. It's all about finding the side that works for you. The lemonade was great, especially the cherry lemonade.

Secondly, they have AMAZING fall off the bone ribs. We have tried both the baby back and spare ribs and both have been delicious. On top of the great ribs and the BBQ sauce, they also have delicious fries, onion rings, and my girlfriend absolutely loves their ranch!

That's all there really is to it, especially if you like wraps and fast-ish food that isn't ungodly unhealthy for you.. and let's face is, most of it is. \\n\\nFood: YAY! Just yay! Everything I've tried here so far is great. They have 4 wraps that you can choose from, which are regular, whole wheat, Spinach and Herb, and Sundried Tomato. Whole wheat is usually my weapon of choice, but I've had the sundried tomato one as well and it was a-okay in my book. Oh, one more thing! They also have a gluten free wrap, so if you or somebody you know is gluten-free this place is fine. If you don't feel like a wrap, they have a variety of other options, such as bowls, plates, and salads...but really, wraps are just amazing and you should feel bad if you don't want to try one. Next is the meat. Omnomnom, meat. You can get chicken, steak, vegetarian fafalal, or crab (which of course costs extra.) I've had the chicken and steak. Both of them are good, but I prefer the chicken just because it's the healthier option and I'm pretty sure I could never get sick of chicken. Ever. The toppings are plentiful and I won't name all of them off, but the bonus here is that you can get hummus as a topping. YAY! They also have feta cheese. DOUBLE YAY! \\n\\nSauces: Yes, this gets its own category because their sauces are awesome as well. They have some crazy ones, such as Mango Curry, and Citrus, but all of the basics are there too. Ranch, Chipotle, Buffalo, etc. They have a special Zikiz's sauce, but don't worry, it's basically a posh oil blend. Once again, all of the sauces I've had were good. The Mango Curry is my favorite, by far, since it's sweet, but has a little tang to it as well. It's perfect for a chicken and hummus wrap. \\n\\nCustomer Service: I've been there a few times now and every time I go, the people working are extremely friendly. You are greeted and helped right away. The people are knowledgeable about the work environment and are readily available to hear you out for all of your Zikiz needs. In fact, if it's your first time, they are more then willing to explain the process of wrap making for you. The last time I was there, I had to get a gluten-free wrap for my friend, but didn't know what she wanted on it. She was at home sick, so I called her and asked. We were luckily the only ones in the store at the time, but when all was said and done, they ended up making her another wrap because the gluten-free ones tend to get hard after awhile. This impressed me, even though it was my fault it took so long. They were also patient. \\n\\nSo this place is amazing and it's definitely on my must eat at when I'm feeling lazy but fairly healthy at the time days. One of the reviews said it best. It's like Chipotle, but 10x healthier. They also sell humus and an assortment of gluten free items in a freezer they have there. Worth a gander if you are ever in the area. The only downside is that it's tucked away in a corner of the Smiths shopping center, so it doesn't stand out. Fear not, because it will after you eat there!\", 5)\n",

We waited for ten mins for the server to get us water and our orders to be put in. We had to flag some manger to get someone to attend to us. \\n\\nNow comes the good part dinner. We order fried calamari, pancake, and BBQ pork. Out of the three the BBQ pork was the best. The pancake was too powdery too me. And the calamari it was all batter! Horrible. As for our main course the duck soup with noodles was bland. Shrimp fried rice was okay but lucky for me they had sriracha  the house special noodles was okay but again sriracha is needed again.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, come here for BBQ pork. If you really have too. I mean if you have no where else to go and your super hungry. Other than that if you still have the power to wait else where to eat then go somewhere else.

We started with the Warm Prosciutto Wrapped House Made Mozzarella ($4.50).. all I have to say is that I wish I had a nice glass of red to go with this tasty treat! The prosciutto was awesome but the house pulled mozzarella, to die for! In fact it was so good we asked to buy a pound to go!

If I wouldn't come off as rude and desperate I would have easily licked the plate.\\n\\nNext up we shared a side of their house made dill pickles ($1.50).. a nice bowl filled with tender well spiced pickles.. man, I sure love a nice pickle! Juicy with slightly crunchy tenderness these were so good I just about scarfed the bowl myself. Next up we ordered Marinated Mushroom ($3.50) which came with toasted slices of Simply Bread cibatta. Each tender bite was a flavor explosion of earthy sweet balsamic tastiness, here comes that wine craving again. The deal here is that I'm low carbin' so it took some restraint not to tear into the bread with the mushrooms. Fortunately the Mr isnt low carbin' so I was able to live vicariously through him, he shook his head in pleasure.  \\n\\nUp next were our lunch entrees, the Mr had the 1/2 Cuban Sandwich and a bowl of soup ($9). The soup was sausage white bean that I could smell from across the table. He went ahead and got me a nice spoon full of seasoned broth and a large thick slice of sausage. Okay there is soup and there is soup, this was excellent. Hot, creamy and deeply satisfying this was one of the quality your Italian grandmother would have made for you as a kid! The Cuban sandwich was huge tender slices of Roast Pork, Ham melted Provolone, House Sweet Pickles, Dijon Aioli on Ciabatta Bread. Uh, come on now, seriously? This is just about everything you could ask for in a sandwhich. Chewy fresh baked bread, hot slices of slightly salty meats and melted cheese, major love was dripping from this sandwich.\\n\\nMy lunch was the Chopped Chef Salad w/ Romaine Hearts, Turkey, Bacon, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Egg, Red Onion, Avocado & Blue Cheese Dressing ($12). Low cabin' doesn't get much better than this! Each bite was absolutely different with combination of so many fresh and tasty ingredients.

I had the cuban pork sandwich. The pork was very moist and tender. Everything was very fresh. The portions large. I was only able to eat half of the sandwich because I was saving room for dessert. I had the peanut butter and chocolate covered pretzel ice cream. It was wonderful. I wish I would have found this little gem earlier. I will be going back again very soon.', 5)\n",
      "(\"DAAAYUM!!! The previous reviews of this restaurant were very good and I set out to try it before...but it was closed. I forgot about it for a few weeks and decided to give it another shot this afternoon for lunch. I am so glad that I remembered this place!\\n\\nI am not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. The place is in the back corner of a little strip shopping center which was otherwise non-descript and I would probably have driven past unless I was specifically looking for something. As I approached I saw a nice size patio with outdoor seating. It was a nice day and I was tempted, but I went inside. The dining area was very spacious containing several tables without being overcrowded. Another thing that stood out was the smell. It smelled really good and it further increased my hunger.\\n\\nThe table was big, which is a good characteristic for me. I don't know how many places I go and they stick the big dude at the little table. I also thought the menu was cool. Nice thin wooden cover with an expansive listing of sandwiches, entrees, beers and wines. I would love to go back for the wine dinner, but being lunch I just ordered a sandwich. Another nice touch was the silverware. The waitress brought the silverware to the table in a mason jar. It is something different and really makes the place cool. Great atmosphere.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich - which I don't care for chicken salad, but I did have a taste and it was good. Chicken, apples, nuts - very hardy. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was piled high. Good solid bread, thick meat and an incredible taste.  I had the potato salad side and my friend had the pasta salad. One thing I liked about both salads and the chicken salad also was the focus on flavor and ingredients. These items were not loaded down with mayo like so many other places. Instead, this restaurant let the main ingredients do the talking - the chicken salad made the chicken the focus item, followed by the apple and nuts. No heavy mayonnaise. Same with the potato salad - you tasted the Yukon yellow gold potatoes. The bread & butter pickles as a garnish took me back to my youth. My grandmother in Southern Ohio canned bread & butter pickles annually. Yum.\\n\\nI had to go for dessert, but I went with something small. I went with the lemon bar - sweet, tart and tasty. I wouldn't go specifically for the lemon bar as I might with something like Oregano's cookie, but this was a good finish to the meal. The sandwiches were both $8.50 (and well worth it), the lemon bar was an economical $2. Another cool & funky aspect of dinner was the smashed bottle serving plate. I like quirky little touches like that which help make the experience unique and memorable.\\n\\nReally the only thing that might be a fraction of a reduction for me was that it was a little loud and made it challenging to hear the conversation and the soda was a standard 20 oz bottle rather than a fountain drink. Small things and not really distracting from the overall excellent experience. I will definitely be back to this place many times. If you are in or around the area, stop by and make sure to give this place a try!\", 5)\n",
      "(\"This place is awesome.  The service is great and the food is the best I've had for the price.  Ive tried a few different things on the menu and haven't been disappointed.

For my review this time I wanted to focus on the ice cream. Holy freak! First, it is only $2 for a small ramekin. The ice cream is freshly created by the pastry chef, Nicole - there were some normal sounding options such as mint chocolate chip, but I wanted something different. I ordered the Red Chile honey ice cream and my friend chose the coconut, roasted peanut & chocolate chip ice cream. There was a lot going on with these dishes. The red Chile was smooth and creamy with a bit of a bite at the end. Loved it! The second dish had a good taste, but the texture was different - a little dry and crumbly...didn't stop me from eating it. Looking at the board I wanted to try the Fennel - so I ordered that. Nicole brought it out and said she wasn't happy with the texture of the coconut, so there wouldn't be a charge for this one. It was smooth and creamy as well - the fennel flavor hit at the end. \\n\\nI really loved the unusual flavors and the fact that they were home made. I am only sad that it took me a while to find this place the first time and secondly that I am not eating there daily. This is one of the best places not only in QC, but Phoenix in general.\", 5)\n",

But one thing to say is COME HUNGRY as the sandwich sizes are big!  The sides were better than I was hoping for as I almost asked for a second round of their potato salad!  The one nice touch I liked was the old school Coca-Cola in a bottle that started everything off on the right foot...  The staff was very attentive and we had no problem getting someones attention if we needed anything.  The only negative thing I would say, like in other posts below, is that while the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella was really delicious, the VERY SMALL three pieces would not allow for us to give a family of four a shot at trying it.  I would suggest that they bump up the number of pieces to at least 5.  All in all a great experience!', 5)\n",

Anyway it was so good, the service was great, I think I have told everyone I talk to about them.

The food was beyond my expectations.  I ordered the steak special with 'Fries' that were more like gourmet rosemary potato spears (with 3 inch rosemary sprig protruding)!    The steak was incredible.  Half way through my meal I realized there was a steak knife on my plate that I had failed to use but had not noticed.  It was so tender, it cut just as easily with the butter knife I had been using.  \\n\\nOur waiter had a true 'ownership mentality.'  I do not know whether he was an owner, but he cared as much about our experience and our opinion.

It had lots of fresh ingredients on it, sauce had a nice flavor, and the dough was just right.   We also got this Cuban pork sandwich and some kind of seafood sandwich.  Everyone liked the Cuban one best, but the other was also great.  Their bread was fresh and so were the ingredients and everything had a great flavor.  The potato salad on the side was one of the best I've ever had.  Also, whatever they gave us for the pre-meal bread, which was like a bruschetta topping, was awesome.  All of this and we didn't even get to try some of their delicious sounding entrees.\\n\\nThe place has a very casual and eclectic feel.  It has a nice mom & pop laid back feel to it and is still trendy with a nice wine & beer selection with a great quiet atmosphere.

      "('After searching Yelp for other restaurants in our area with great reviews, it seemed to me that The Deli was going to be a new hit for our family. Needless to say it was an epic FAIL. Everything about this place, including the name is mediocre. We walked into the restaurant which looks like an old beat up hole in the wall that should be featured on Chef Ramsey\\'s Kitchen Nightmares. Warning! The place looks nothing like the pictures featured on it\\'s website. I ordered a turkey sandwich (hold the cheese, hold the mayo), add avocado, and add cucumbers. The avocado was an additional 1.50, which wasn\\'t a big surprise considering most places up charge for avocado. I was appalled to see that I was charged .45 for cucumber after the check arrived. Get real, The Deli, a whole cucumber costs that much. My husband got a meatball sub which was decent. It wasn\\'t anything special and he said he likes Subway\\'s meatball sub even better. My children split the mac n cheese meal and it was fine. Again nothing special. The atmosphere is horrendous. We sat on the patio facing Queen Creek\\'s finest meth lab, a boarded up house. The plants on the patio were mostly wilted. They had one shade up and one shade down, which doesn\\'t sound that bad, but it appeared to me that they were rarely touched. The door leading to the patio had some janky door handle that looked like a bent metal coat hanger. Our silverware was brought out in glass jars as was our check. The kids menu was a 6\" x 3\" piece of card stock that was so full of wrinkles it looked like the previous patron attempted an origami. We were told to get out own drinks. None of this would have been as big of a deal if we purchased a 20.00 meal. And even if it was just 20.00, we still probably wouldn\\'t return. When the waiter came out, he presented a 35.00 check. I thought \"for a turkey sandwich, meatball sandwich, and a small side of noodles?!?!?!\" This was when I noticed that they had all these miscellaneous charges like .45 cucumbers. How about you credit me for the mayo/cheese I didn\\'t receive. I was so irritated for a second I thought about not even tipping especially considering the waiter didn\\'t do anything but bring us the menu, take our order, and take our money. But I realized he shouldn\\'t be penalized for his crappy employer. This place is so overpriced and yet spends very little to convey that they actually care about their patrons.

The bread looked and tasted like basic cheap store bought bread. I guess I was expecting fresh baked bread instead of something I could make at home. I was also surprised that our sandwiches did not come with fries, potato chips, or some kind of potato salad or slaw. Most places include something other than the two tiny pickles with a sandwich. My husband wouldn't even try the pickles because he said it looked like something that had been thrown on the floor. I tried the pickle and was kinda grossed out because it was soggy. I've never had a soggy pickle in my life. I also ordered scrambled eggs for my toddler and once again I felt the eggs I make at home taste better. My husband did enjoy his bacon sandwich but also felt the bread was mediocre. We also ordered a margherita pizza to share. The pizza was the worst disappointment of all. It came on a thin lavosh bread which is more like a extra thin flat bread. It did not taste fresh. I even looked at pictures on yelp of the pizza and what we were served looked nothing like those pictures.

It's got interesting decor made out of burlap coffee bags and wine bottles, which makes it a neat place to dine.  The sandwiches are so delicious, my absolute favorite is their Reuben - it's loaded with hot pastrami and tasty goodness. Their soups have been consistently good,and their bruschetta and carrot cake are addicting.  It's also one of the best restaurants in Queen Creek, so if you live around the area you need to try it!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the Deli is no longer open for dinner, breakfast and lunch only and they're open Wednesday through Sunday 7am-3pm with lunch starting at 10:30am.  It also tends to get a little loud in there as it is a popular eatery with poor acoustics, and you should expect to be there a while because it takes time to make Queen Creek's best sandwiches!

Needless to say, it was something really cool to see done and I was really impressed by that. \\n\\nThe next thing I\\'ll note is that the man who was our server (and who I presumed to be the owner) could not have been a nicer guy. They have a special there that if you bring a \"sushi virgin\" with you, you get a roll on the house. This was 100% correct as the man hooked my buddy up with a free roll, and it wasn\\'t the least expensive roll we ordered, but he picked the most expensive one to give us free of charge! Talk about a nice guy and great service. \\n\\nNow on to the sushi itself. Their selection of specialty rolls was quite impressive (I recommend the Alaska, Arizona, and Sunset rolls) and they did well to keep the classics well made as well. \\n\\nThe one gripe I will say is that since there was only one sushi chef working it did take a little longer than I would have hoped to get our food but it wasn\\'t an overly excessive wait to where I got upset and/or restless. \\n\\nSo overall, I had a very positive experience with Fresh Wasabi and recommend it to anyone who loves some quality sushi at an extremely reasonable price. I\\'ll definitely be back the next time I swing back down to the area.', 5)\n",

It's a very quaint family like atmosphere. My youngest son insists we go there and only there for sushi. He & I had dinner a there a couple weeks ago, nothing has changed. The excellent food and service were not a fluke. I am so excited I found this place in November. I plan on becoming one of their many regulars although I've only been there twice. I will have my son's 14th birthday dinner at Fresh Wasabi per his request. I highly recommend this place. I am a huge sushi fan, food and service like Fresh Wasabi provides is hard to find.\", 5)\n",

My daughter got a kick out of that!! \\n\\nIt is a small establishment but it does allow the owner to be more in tuned with the customers. He walks arounds, greets all customers and even takes orders if the place is busy. He learned it was our first time and made sure we were pleased with EVERYTHING!

LOW PRICES!\\n\\nYou may find a sushi restaurant out in Scottsdale, with a better sushi selection and slightly better sushi quality.

Very happy with the seating layout, despite the smaller size.  Appropriate music played at an appropriate volume.  Kid friendly.  Great spot to take your family, or to have a date.  Probably want to keep a group at no more than 6 unless not a busy time.\", 5)\n",

Cherry Blossom Roll was beautiful and tasty! I grew up in Japan and love sushi so this place will always have a fond memory in my belly and taste buds.  Not big but comfortable surroundings.  Prices also are good and actually cheap compared to other sushi places I've been to.\", 5)\n",

      "(\"Can you say food poisoning? \\n\\nIt was obvious as we walked in the door that this place was trying to cut down on expenses. They had turned off the air conditioning when it was 100 degrees outside and had large ceiling fans going on full blast. This was highly irritating as the fans not only dried out my food but did a number on my eyes also. The women waitresses were very kind and at times almost too eager to take our order as we were asked by three different people what we wanted. When we got our sushi for two it was WARM! I'm not talking about good old fried Las Vegas roll warm, I'm talking shashimi over rice. I've been to several countries and eaten plenty of raw things and assumed it would be ok since about 99% of the time my stomach can handle it. I was wrong. I wonder now if they had turned down the cooling case where the sushi is stored? I would bet if the health department did a random inspection they are not keeping it kept at the right temperature. \\n\\nTo top off the lukewarm fish, the people at the table next to us got drunk and started yelling at the waitress about being overcharged. I really should give them more stars just for the entertainment value of watching them try to communicate to drunken hillbillies. \\n\\nWell the joke was on me because I soon realized what they were angry about. We came with a groupon and they applied the discount after tax. They don't print out an itemized bill they just give you the paper with the total so you don't really know what your bill was.... But I'm on to you Fresh Wasabi! I don't know on what planet they thought that was ok because I have never NEVER been to a place that does this. Our bill was only about $40 so a few dollars here or there was not a big deal to me but to the hillbillies who racked up a $180 bill it was a big deal. After many threats from the drunks to call the police they finally left and as our entertainment factor dwindled we vowed never to trek out to Surprise for irritable bowls ever again.\", 1)\n",

If I close my eyes right now, I can still feel and taste them as if I were still sitting in the restaurant.  Now that is GREAT FOOD!!!!!  I have to say the Main Man agreed as he gave an added tip exclusively to the creator of the fabulous sushi rolls.\\n\\nWe began the meal with the same waitress as last time.  As I said before, she was polite and attentive but something was missing.  I slapped my Yelp deal onto the table and all of a sudden we had the most delightful woman serving us; she told us we were the first Yelp deal customers and broke into some cordial and sincere conversation about Fresh Wasabi and our prior visits.  She was not dressed like a server so I have to guess that she sits a bit higher in the hierarchy but she was a gem and cleared up my previous issues with the service (again, always good, but lacking something warm, sincere, and interested in our business).   \\n\\nSo now we begin our quest to try each and every roll on the menu... mmmmmmmmmm...\", 5)\n",

This week we gave the Spider Roll, Guilty Pleasure Roll, Untouchable Roll, First Love Roll, and Philly Roll a try... if you like tempura (and FW does it very well) you will absolutely love the variety of flavor and texture offered in the Untouchable and Spider Rolls.  The heftiness of those two were very nicely contrasted by the lightness and citrus in the First Love and the touch of spice and heat offered by the Guilty Pleasure.  The Philly was a solid, simple, basic roll that made for a good palate cleanser between the varied selection of tempura, spice, and citrus and probably enhanced our enjoyment of all the rolls.\\n\\nWe added Sake Bombs to the meal this time and thought the libation was fun!  We had Mochi Ice Cream as a small treat to close the meal... and WOW, was it good!!  Again, a fabulous contrast in temperatures, textures, and subtle flavors between the outside layer and the inside ice cream.\\n\\nWhy did I add the 5th star, you ask?

I look and sure enough same game.  When I complain this time though she suddenly remembers and proceeds to rant 4 different times that she took it on the chin last time for $7.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  You don't want people using coupons-don't put them out there-only to have them come in and then cheat them.   I have two more of these coupons and WILL NOT BOTHER to go back.  I do not expect them to be in business another 6 mos.\\nI have quite a few friends that I have turned on to this place and have become regulars there.

Being a small operation, the ambiance has always been a bit austere, but we immediately noticed some new decor and wall hangings, very lovely! We also noticed that they made a distinct effort at romance for the day with fresh red roses on the tables, many of the staff wearing some red, and a fun display at the greeting station.\\n\\nWe were greeted warmly and happily by the owner and seated at our regular table. We tried the cherry blossom roll, baked lobster roll, and the bronze medal roll this time. All were phenomenal, but we cannot imagine ordering the baked lobster roll without the bronze medal roll at the same time, they were perfectly complimentary to one another!  We paired the cherry blossom with a couple pieces of yellow tail nigiri, very soft and tender with perfect flavor, and we were happy with the match.\\n\\nAs always, presentation was spot-on and the service was great!

I found some of the sushi to be all right - the eel was rather good - but the rolls were small and the sashimi was unimpressive. Being a big sushi fan, I thought it was pretty good for the desert - hey, I\\'m biased, I live in California - and brushed off the high prices and mediocre quality as a result of the lack of competition in the area.\\n\\nFast-forward to today: obviously I\\'d forgotten about the place and bought the Yelp deal thinking my dad and I were going to check it out for the first time for lunch. Wrong; we pulled up to the restaurant and my dad reminded me that this was the sole sushi place we\\'d been to in town. No worries, we decided, we\\'ll eat there for lunch anyways since the lunch bowls looked really good and the Yelp deal was enticing.\\n\\nWe were invited to seat ourselves. When the server brought us the menus, I informed her that I had a Yelp deal. She promptly removed the lunch menus from the table and told me that lunch specials weren\\'t eligible with coupons. All right, I said politely, and my father and I proceeded to look at the menu. \"You sure you don\\'t want to leave?\" my dad asked. I said no and decided that I\\'d just discuss the fact that the Yelp deal doesn\\'t mention any restrictions thus she should honor the deal. In fact, the voucher specifically states, \"Deal must be honored according to terms on voucher. No additional restrictions may be added at time of redemption.\"\\n\\nWell, the server came back to the table to take our order and I immediately mentioned that the Yelp deal does not mention any restrictions. She reiterated that they don\\'t allow ordering lunch specials with a coupon. At this point it became an argument; I again tried to tell her that the Yelp deal doesn\\'t list restrictions and that she is supposed to honor the deal as provided. She didn\\'t let me finish my sentence and hurried back to grab the lunch menus, hastily and rudely shoving the lunch menus back onto the table and walking away. \\n\\nMy dad and I looked at each other in disbelief. He suggested we leave and eat lunch at Macayo\\'s, the popular local chain of Mexican restaurants. Done deal, I said, and we walked out.\\n\\nHopefully I\\'ll be able to get my Yelp deal refunded. There is no way I am ever going back. It was mediocre sushi in the first place; if it makes me a snobby Californian for bashing the place then so be it, because all of these reviews of \"great sushi\" are total B.S. and I\\'m guessing a lot the reviewers haven\\'t eaten the good stuff (I myself had never had truly decent sushi until I moved to California).

I had never had Turkish Coffee before going there for the first time, and it's delicious, but word to the wise, don't drink it too late! Also, the stuffed grape leaves are awesome, very lemony.  Last week I tried the Garlic Potato Bourekas. My new favorite! As I understand, they're about the add a lot more items to the menu.\", 5)\n",

After checking out Spices on non other than Yelp.com and checking their menu on their web site, I thought that this place was worth a try.  My mom and I were greeted very warmly as soon as we entered the place by the owners ( a husband and wife team).  She told us that the food was made from real family recipes that were from her husbands side of the family.  We decided to order the Labni cheese appetizer, Aegean salad and the Bourekas entree(my favorites were the salad and the entree).  They all had very interesting flavors.  We were very pleased and it was definitely enough food for the two of us.  My mom also ordered an ice tea and stated, as a tea expert, that it tasted fresh (which does not happen at all restaurants).  We sat out on the porch which was nice and quiet.  A bus boy came by to clear our plates as soon as we were done with them which was pleasantly unexpected because this is not a sit-down-waiter type restaurant.  The owners also came by several times to see if we needed anything and if the food met our expectations.  Hands down: this place has the best customer service that I have experienced in a long time.  With great food and great service this meal was a wonderful experience; even for a picky, pregnant, vegetarian like myself!', 5)\n",

I don't how how one can consistently have bitter food for 2 yars now and still not correct it. They also used to have decent tomato (with carrots) soup. Of late it has become more carrot and badly seasoned. Speaking of seasoning this is another problem that they seem to be having. I'm sure the cook never tastes anything he puts out (or maybe they are short on basic seansoning, or in a more positive light maybe they have an agenda to reduce salt intake for all humankind) \\n\\nFor Mediterranean food I would rather go to Pita Jungle about 2 miles east of this place.

      "(\"WAY OVERPRICED & NOTHING GREAT! THIS PLACE SUCKS!\\n\\nI don't know what is wrong with all the reviewers here, as very few of them have mentioned what a true rip-off this place really is. Am I the only one to notice how grossly over the top their prices are for what you get? \\n\\nI ordered the Shawarma combo of lamb and beef, a cheese crisp and a drink; it was almost $17.00 w/ tax. If the food was amazing, I might have overlooked the steep price, but it wasn't anything special. I've had so much better food at other Mediterranean places and for a lot less. What really added insult to injury on this visit was after spending so much on lunch for just myself, the guys behind the counter gave me crap because I asked for some hot sauce after I already received my food. This was because they wanted to charge me for it, which was nothing more than a little cup of pickled green chili peppers. It would have made more sense for them to just have Sarachi sauce available. As I ate my lunch, I was reminded, yet again, by another person who took my money at the register (who I assume to be the owner) about paying for the sauce. He had the nerve to come up to me and say that the next time I come in, make sure I ask for the hot sauce with my order. What next time? The only satisfaction I got out of this experience was not having to pay the extra $.75 for the sauce. \\n\\nThere used to be a great authentic Middle Eastern place at Rural and Ray Road called Zake, The owner was from Lebanon and he charged  average prices for nice portions. The food was excellent and the owner worked with only one chef. This place didn't make it and closed after a couple years. It's sad because his place deserved success and it seems like some of the locally run places can't compete with the chains. The customers of Spices are blind if they allow the place to continue to charge so much for such mediocre food. There's enough people living in this town who are oblivious to the rip-off  and so they'll no doubt support it. If this place is still in business a year from now, consumers can only blame themselves.\", 1)\n",

I am in a short line and the bus boy comes to ask if I need anything, he is oblivious that I had an order, mine was clearly lost. The guy at the register who I believe was the manager or owner himself, was so upset that I wanted a refund, he said he was not going to apologize and didn't feel he owed me an apology because it was busy and I should expect to wait.

Perhaps the kitchen's timing and efficiency needs a little work.

To my deep regret, it was so good, I wish I had ordered their 2-pound (1kg) cut. More than enough meat for any man. But wait -- there\\'s more! We haven\\'t even touch the pig\\'s foot!\\n\\nYes, pork trotter -- pig\\'s foot. Stuffed, braised, baked. It\\'s amazingly, succulently, stupendously supple and tender and tasty. And it comes with or without foie gras stuffing. You can get foie gras with anything. You can get it atop poutines -- Quebec\\'s quintessential dish of squeeky fresh cheese curds and fries drowned in hot gravy. You can get it by itself. You can try it for yourself. You can have foie gras and hams, Sam-I-Am.\\n\\nEvery ingredient is from a local farmer. Everything is hand-made -- they even brew their own PDC beer. Every time I\\'ve gone, every person working there has been beyond gracious. Everything I\\'ve said above is why Au Pied De Cochon has been a smashing success since its opening in 2001. Make reservations, folks. I doubt they ever run out of pig\\'s foots, but I know they run out of seating every night.\\n\\nPDC is world class. If the exchange rate weren\\'t so hellish, I\\'d be there now, enjoying the marvelous Montreal summer and PDC -- the second best thing about Montreal.\\n\\nP.S.

      "(\"Over Labor Day weekend I was in Montreal visiting a friend who insisted if I wanted to taste the best the city has to offer we needed to eat at Au Pied de Cochon. \\n\\nAfter making reservations nearly two months in advance, last Saturday night we went for dinner.  The restaurant is sparsely decorated with hardwood floors, plain tables, and an open kitchen.  It is clear that the main focus at Au Pied is not the decor, but the food.\\n\\nFor starters we enjoyed the Foie Gras Cromesquis.  These tasty fried cubes of liquefied foie gras explode in your mouth the instant they are bitten into releasing way more flavor than can be imagined.  Next my friend and I both chose the Bison Tartare as an appetizer.  Served in the bowl it was prepared in, the bison meat is mixed with onions and a minimal amount of spices and comes with half a quail egg for the dinner to mix into the meat.  The preparation is simple, but it really allows all the flavor to come out.  For an entree my friend insisted I try the Duck in a Can.  At first this sounded odd, but after our server explained the preparation I was sold.  The meal includes a large portion of foie gras, duck meat, as well as a good helping of duck fat.  Since the meal is stored in the can before it is served, all the flavors melt together into one incredibly rich dish.  For dessert, we shared a blueberry pie for two.  The crust was layered with an almond paste, fresh Canadian blueberries, and topped with a thin layer of cr\\\\u00e8me br\\\\u00fbl\\\\u00e9e.  With all these ingredients I assumed the dessert would be heavy, but it was surprisingly airy without losing any of the flavor.\\n\\nOne of the best parts of the experience was our server.  He answered any and all of our questions, and we could tell he was excited and passionate about the food.\\n\\nOverall, I'd have to say that my meal at Au Pied de Cochon was one of the best meals I've had in a long while.\", 5)\n",
      "('I went this restaurant twice during my recent visit to Montreal because I had previewed their menu online and there were so many choices that there was no way we would be able to experience it all.  A good portion of their menu contains foie gras (of which they are very famous for) but they also have a lot of fresh seafood. \\n\\nOn the first visit, we had the bison tartare and foie gras cromesquis(which is a deep-fried breaded foie gras ball, similar concept to deep fried mozza sticks). The cromesquis were absolutely divine!  My friend ordered the french onion soup. It was very rich and had a strong wine flavour. For entrees, my friend had the infamous \"Duck in a Can\". She loved it while I thought it wasn\\'t really my style. It was very heavy and rich. She loved the flavours. I would recommend it to someone who likes stew-like dishes. The foie gras that was in this dish was a little to overwhelming for me. Again, this is a personal taste thing. I ordered the lobster-roll with foie gras on top. This dish was fabulous! The lobster-roll was on-par with some of the best ones I\\'ve had in Maine. The bread was toasted perfectly. The slices of foie gras on top made it even more decadent. The lobster had a perfect texture and were in large chunks.\\n\\nOn the second visit, my friend and I shared their dinner special which was arctic char for two with a pesto on top and served with deep-fried polenta sticks. The fish was cooked to perfection. I was really surprised that we were served the whole fish on a giant platter and this entree was only $50. Usually when I order an arctic char entree at other restaurants, I would only get a small section of the fish and the entree would already by around $25.  \\n\\nThe service on both visits was excellent. I couldn\\'t have asked for better. The servers were very patient and very good at explaining the menu. Definitely a very memorable experience and a must-try (at least once) in Montreal. If you\\'ve never had foie gras before, this is the place to experience it. They don\\'t skimp on the foie gras portions and you really get to truly experience the taste of foie gras.', 5)\n",
      "(\"Um this place rocks..... Walking in to view the magic butchery of their open kitchen is in itself a sometimes jaw dropping experience, then the food beautiful but its not about it being dressed up. Its not, its simply fantastic, Duck in a Can - is genius - highest quality ingredients anyone could hope consume and then have a CVA over. I aspire to revisit whenever in Montreal... Seriously a must, and a much more fun atmo than L'Express ....\", 5)\n",
      "('If you find Foie Gras offensive, please don\\'t read this review or visit this restaurant.  If, on the other hand, you have no issue with overfeeding yourself on overfed food, then this might just be the best restaurant you will ever go to.  I currently rate it in my top 5 lifetime and have the experience and burgeoning gut to prove it.  The restaurant serves up a great mix of fine french and regional cuisine, with a bit of a comical twist at times.  Further, all sections of the menu include some kind of Foie Gras offering.  For example, for a starter I ordered their version of Poutine (a Montreal drunken specialty consisting of fries, gravy, and cheese curds).  Their version complimented the offering with a \"healthy\" dose of Foie Gras as well as Foie Gras gravy.  For my main course I had a Foie Gras burger and my friend had the Tripe Pizza.  All of it was pure culinary genius.  You just know that the folks here love what they do and work hard to make the meals creative, delicious, and indulgent.  To top it off, the wine selection was broad and reasonable and the coffee and sweets perfect.  If you have but one night in Montreal, you should eat here and forget about the guilt until the morning.', 5)\n",
      "('This was one of our favorite meals in Montreal. I love game meat, I love foie gras, et j\\'adore la cuisine Qu\\\\u00e9b\\\\u00e9coise, so I was in heaven here. However, you should probably not go here and expect an elegant fine dining experience. It\\'s pretty small, very crowded, and very loud, and has a very casual interior with wooden tables - it\\'s not a place you necessarily need to get dressed up for. You definitely need a reservation if you don\\'t want to stand waiting for hours; we had a reservation and got seated within about 15 minutes, but there were people who got there before us that were still waiting 2 hours later.  Despite the inventiveness of the menu and the relatively high prices, the food is not really haute cuisine per se. However, that does not make it any less delicious, in my opinion. The foie gras section on the menu has over 10 selections, but some of them make you go \"whaa...?\", like foie gras poutine and foie gras hamburger. The atmosphere is a lot like my favorite restaurant back home, which is not too fancy but just has really good food. The wine list was excellent with an extensive French selection. We started out with a bottle of Pouilly-Fuiss\\\\u00e9, but since the bottle we ordered was not available, the manager brought us out a Pommard he said was even better and was also less expensive, which was very nice. We started out with a plate of mixed p\\\\u00e2t\\\\u00e9 and some zucchini blossom tempura - the tempura was very light and pleasing. We moved on to two more delicious dishes, a tomato tartine and tarragon bison tongue. The tart was on this light fluffy pastry dough, and the bison tongue was extremely tasty. By that time we had moved on to a bottle of Old Vine Ch\\\\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, also excellent. Our main course was the foie gras poutine - just had to do it - seared foie gras on top of fries, gravy, and cheese curds, and it was everything I thought it would be. I figured I was probably only going to have poutine once so it might was well be the most decadent. We finished things up with a dessert of maple churros, espresso and cognac. Afterwards the manager came by our table and brought us each a complimentary shot of Bushmills and drank it with us. It was just a really great experience.\\n\\nP.S. I read a quote about this place afterward that gave me a smile: \"No animal is safe from his kitchen\"', 5)\n",

Because of the episode, I took it as an omen and put it down as a must try. After all, I admire Bourdain's sense of adventure and trust his palate that has taken him all over the world so the fact that he got really stuffed here, it must be good. And I (or he?) was right.\\n\\nThis restaurant, in my opinion, does not serve your fancy gourmet. It is a bit of french country with a whole lot of boldness in using unusual ingredients. I loved my chicken hearts salad with the perrrrrfectly soft boiled eggs. The pickled bison tongue had a well-balanced acid bite that savors your appetite and wanting for more. The entrees were decadent. My boyfriend had an amazing lamb shank and he couldn't resist the fries in duck fat. As for me, I took the duck in a can. Foie gras, duck fat and breast, balsamic and red wine reduction, and thyme all cook in a can. When served, the waiter comes with a can opener and then pour it on top of a nicely toasted butter brioche. It's a lot of yummy gooey duck fat in a can and I can attest that it taste even better the next day. \\n\\nService is great and they are people that knows and proud of their food. They also have a great wine and beer list. It is a very good restaurant and I love that they don't serve your typical food. If you're looking for a culinary experience and adventurous eating, this is one of the best concepts out there. Don't trust me?

It just doesn't come together at all, too disjointed.  Also the combinatorics just don't work -- there aren't enough fries, you just can't get the right ratios of everything together.\\n\\nAlso be careful not to get too many dishes that are meat or poultry with the same seasonings on the same mashed potatoes with veggies.

On our minimoon in Montreal APDC was the first restaurant we specifically wanted to visit (we actually built our visit around this restaurant after watching the Tony Bourdain No Reservations episode...).\\n\\nMy husband and I are used to ordering tasting menus - or at least an appetizer, entr\\\\u00e9e and dessert each when we dine - to be able to get as diverse a sampling as possible, of different things on the menu.  This was our approach as we set to tackle the APDC menu for the first time, where one gets spare, one-line titles for the selections and virtually no other description.  However, we were saved from our folly by our kind server, who cautioned us that the dishes were very large, very filling, and we were not likely to make it through a dinner we had orignially contemplated.\\n\\nHe steered us instead towards ordering an appetizer to share, then a couple of \"medium-sized\" dishes:\\n\\nVenison tartare - delicous, rare, tender, served with a raw egg and a few salad greens which were dressed with nice acid.\\n\\nFoie Gras poutine - not as tasty as I\\'d hoped, but the slowly melting Foie on top of the hot poutine did impart an amazing layer of flavourand complexity to the dish.\\n\\nBoudin and Foie Gras tart - as fantastic and rich as it sounds; it was all we could do to finish every last bit.  Fat liver on fat blood sausage on fattyrich tart pastry. Wonderful!\\n\\nAbsinthe to end -- perfect for cutting through all the richness...\\n\\nWe returned 2 days later and chose to dine at the counter.

Martin Picard, the owner and chef of PDC has a penchant for my number favorite food stuff of all time: Foie Gras. His menu is littered with Foie Gras. The menu has items and then with added Foie Gras just to make it even better. Just with that he would score points with me. I was simply unprepared for the ways he presents Foie Gras and it changed everything.\\n\\nYou\\'re probably saying \"Dave, you\\'re going overboard here, Foie Gras is good but it\\'s not life altering\" to which I answer \"Sit down, shut up and read on\" because you obviously haven\\'t been to PDC and have experienced what I have experienced. I\\'m sure it\\'s the kind f elevating sensation those religious people experience during conversion.\\n\\nIt started with The Cube or as the menu calls it Foie Gras Cromesquis. When your plate is presented the waiter has to give you some instruction first. He explains that it\\'s a Foie Gras Terrine breaded and then deep fried. The terrine is now liquefied so you must wait a minute or two for it cool down and when you do bite down on it, keep your mouth closed. I looked at him with incredulous eyes. I take hold of the breaded cube, put it on my tongue and closed my mouth as the waiters behind the bar looked on, I bit down on it and then... time... stopped... My eyes closed and I wanted to say something but the Cromesquis exploded into a liquid spray of flavor napalm. At that very moment I could have died and it would have ok. This was only the beginning.\\n\\nI then continued this blissful expedition to culinary perdition with an off-menu item that was offered to us. Fried-Head cheese on a Gribiche sauce. The Head-Cheese was breaded with a smear of goat cheese on top and the Gribiche was just so good that I cleaned out the plate. The head cheese was so far beyond what I expected. The meat tastes so much stronger and is more diverse in flavors. Unbelievable and the best head-cheese I\\'ve ever had in my life.\\n\\nDid you think we we\\'re done with entr\\\\u00e9e? Oh HELLLLL NO. Picard mixes Quebec\\'s masterpiece of fast-food with Foie-Gras and turns into an orgasmatron of taste and sensation. Poutine with Foie Gras. Just the idea was mind-boggling and the execution was akin to sex with a very willing firm horny barely legal co-ed. I\\'ve had a lot of Foie Gras before but this was simply the most textured, flavored and fragrant one I ever tasted. I just wanted to bash my head on the bar it was so good.\\n\\nI ordered the restaurant\\'s namesake dish, The Pied de Cochon. Pied de Cochon translated means Pig\\'s Foot. And that\\'s what it was. A whole pig\\'s foot and some of the leg too. It was MASSIVE. The meat is removed braised and then stuffed back in the breaded leg with the hooves. It\\'s layed on a bed of mashed potatoes then covered with a medley of tasty and very aromatic veggies, some of which I failed to Identify. Oh and yeah with a cherry on the top, another artery clogging portion of Foie Gras. The plates was enough to feed a family of rufees for a week and it was impossible for me to finish it but trust me that no meat was left on the plate, just the hooves and some veggies. Pig\\'s leg is easily the tastiest part but it\\'s work to get at sadly and probably explains why my mother only made Pig Leg Stew once a year.\\n\\nI decided to attack the desert menu. I quickly spotted Pudding Ch\\\\u00f4meur (poor mans pudding) I had to try Picard\\'s take on this cultural institution. I was not dispointed, it was dessert heaven - though my mom\\'s Pouding ch\\\\u00f4meur was light years beyond his - and a brilliant close on the evening.\\n\\nThe service was top notch friendly and unpretentious. If you\\'ve ever seen Picard\\'s show, he looks like a lumberjack, he\\'s not anything like a snotty pedantic chef, he\\'s all about good food and he\\'ll go and kill it himself to get it on the plate. So his staff is equally relaxed and approachable. I\\'m not big on chi-chi restaurant experience and this restaurant looks like a sugar shack and is very laid back while still having 2000$ wine bottles on its wine list. Fine Dinning without the dickishness.\\n\\nLe Pied de Cochon is by far the best restaurant, culinary, eating experience I\\'ve ever had and I can\\'t even begin to explain why. All of the above are mere ramblings of a mad man drugged by an experience that will not soon be overcome. I seriously doubt I can find another food experience to top my carnivorous proclivities anytime soon. Best Foie Gras ever, awesome head cheese, sublime Poutine, insane Pig\\'s Feet. It took me about 3 days to come down from the rush. There is a God and his name is Martin Picard.', 5)\n",

      "(\"We first went to Au Pied de Cochon over 6 years ago. I made the reservation in advance but we were lost and could not find the restaurant. I kept calling the restaurant and let them know that we were late. When we finally got there, almost 1.5 hour later, the restaurant was packed and there was a long line waiting. To our surprise, they kept our table! We were seated right away and the waiter was very patient to explain the menu. We both ordered an appetizer and an entr\\\\u00e9e with a glass of wine. The food was incredibly good and the price was reasonable. It becomes a must-go every time we visit Montreal. \\n\\nOver the years, I have tried most of their foie gras dishes (except for the pork foot stuffed with foie gras, which is too large for one person and I don't have any one to share with), also the venison tartar; my husband has tried most their game dishes, and we have never been disappointed. \\n\\nMy recommendations: 1) Make a reservation or get there early. 2) Avoid the special or be prepared for a sticker shock (my husband ordered their special once; the dish was good but it was much more expensive than the items on the menu.) 3) Check out their wine cellar-- they have a very impressive wine cellar in the back. If you like foie gras, wild game, or a nice bottle of wine to go with your meal, you can't go wrong with this place.\", 5)\n",

      "(\"Like any other food connoisseurs, I have exceptionally picky taste buds and I look for uniqueness that challenges my perception of how food should be prepared. APDC sets the bar up so high that I could hardly find any restaurants in Chicago that could get even close to it. \\n\\nAPDC is daring and unconventional - just don't expect to find your regular coq au vin or poulet roti grand mere *yawn*. Picard's cuisine is meant to shock. There are plenty of items in the menu that one would never thought of eating. How about some head cheese or bison tongue to start the meal? Entree? Well, duck cooked in a can or some heart-attack-inducing blood sausage and foie gras pie sound absolutely delish! \\n\\nAs gross as it may sound to other people, every single meal at APDC ends with a sense of fulfillment. Not just the appetite but the need for someone to prove me wrong for coming to dine with a preconception of what's gross and what's not. Well, folks, there's no need to worry about the dessert part of the meal. They are not going to sneak some trout into your ice cream like the Iron Chef. But they are to die for! Look no further because they have the best, freshly made, lemon meringue pie on the face of the earth - hands down.\\n\\nThe service is second to none. It feels like a friends/family gathering at APDC. The servers & captains are extremely disciplined and super hot. We ordered with the captain but the servers knew exactly what our orders were. The cutlery were perfectly set and the food arrived exactly where they were supposed to be. No questions asked. I dropped my fork and I got another one literally, in five seconds. The restaurant was packed and they were super busy. Yet, they care about details like these. Now, that's excellent service!\\n\\nI have never been disappointed with APDC and I have got to say that this is the best restaurant I've ever been in my life. I don't give a lot of 5 stars but if I could give it a 10, I would. The only regret was I never got a chance to try their pot au feu because I always got the 10pm reservation and they have sold out by then. Well, this won't be my last visit, that's for sure!\", 5)\n",
      "(\"With the caveat that I will not order what I ordered again!(Huge caveat!) This place does it right, though. It is just the cuisine style that I was not up to. \\nPlace is very cute, located on the petite rue Duluth, which is a nice little side street, with cobblestones, and trees.\\nToday was sunny, and the front was open to the sidewalk, so it was quite lovely. As were the adorable waiter, did not mind them at all. The service was great, when I got in right before 6pm (my reservation was at 6, but the seated me a good 15 minutes early!) The service DID slow down, though, around 6:30 as the place filled up. But there were still plenty of servers to take care of everyone.\\nThe food was exceptional. I had a green salad, Au Pied's house beer, and the Foi Gras Poutine. Now, the Poutine, I will admit, was too much for me. Having never had foi gras, or poutine, it was a challenge that really took it out of me. That being said, the foi gras had a good crisp outer layer, the cheese curds were very large, the gravy well flavoured, and the fries were extremely good. I think these may be the best fries I have had. I would go back just for them, they have an excellent flavour, crisp texture, and a deep brown colour. \\nEven the green salad was good. The vinaigrette was very peppery, and had a good over all balance. The greens were varied, and included lots of yummy chutes, and stems as well as leaves. The bread was excellent, goo soft center and hard crust. I was impressed through and through.\\nIf you are not afraid to try honest Quebecois food, this is the place.\", 5)\n",

      "('Oh my God. This restaurant. I. I don\\'t even know why I try to write about it because its my happy place and when I\\'m sad I want to be there, tasting perfection and floating on a big, soft, foie gras cloud of beauty and love. When I get upset and I\\'m close to a computer I go on their website and I cruise their menu, reliving my glory days and dreaming about more to come when I figure out when I can visit their Sugar Shack. \\n\\n::sigh::\\n\\nI\\'ll start at the beginning. Bear with me, this is indeed, one of the experiences of my life I will not forget and I won\\'t skimp. \\n\\nWe called ahead to try to make reservations, but it was early, the message in fast French, and ended without options and just a hang-up. We decided to show up at 5 and try our luck.\\n\\nWe showed up too early and walked around the neighborhood. We observed small dive bars off the main boulevard, little parks and benches we smoked \"waiting\" cigarettes on. Bright painted houses and small plants on windowsills - It was your typical quaint Quebecois neighborhood. I loved it.\\n\\nWe walked into the restaurant when it was time: The phone was ringing off the hook, we were the 3rd party there and one party, of course, has a small child who was letting the world know he was very, very unhappy. We got the furthest table from that family, the waitress somehow read our minds.\\n\\nI sat down and I was looking through the menu and I was so excited. Everything sounds so delicious. How could I choose? \\n\\nI started off with what was easy. I got the house beer, which was very very light, bright golden ale and went down like water. Things felt better after that.\\n\\nThe bread was hearty, fresh, and very nutty -  a little bit of a sourdough thing going on and I liked it. Was not toasted, but the bread spoke for itself. So did the fresh butter in the tiny mason jar...oh homemade butter I love you so! \\n\\nWe started with the marinated smoked sausages, with pork and foie gras. It was that salty, smoky, meaty, somehow lemony taste that makes you think of good pepperoni without that much heat or oil. It was good, and a good portion of it too. \\n\\nNext, was the foie gras cromesquis. The waiter had to stop me before I cut into, what looked like, a cubed, fried cheeseball. He said to just put it on my tongue, keep my mouth closed, and let the liquid inside fill your mouth (Hm, where have I heard these instructions before?? Sorry.)\\n\\nLike a wave of an ocean, the liquid foie gras burst so tiny yet HUGE into my mouth, that gritty cube gave way to a sea of flavors and warm pulsing. It seemed to fill all your senses, you can\\'t hear you were concentrating on the warmth, and your nose smells the cheese it was wrapped in, and the herbs mixed into it, and you were trying to chew and you had the urge to open your mouth to let it all out, its warm and gooey...but its too good to let go. Your reflexes force you swallow you try to control it, the urge to control your gulps and try to savor the moment....and it was gone. I said, \"Wow.\"\\n\\nThis is what food IS. And I\\'m still only on appetizers.\\n\\nThe boy got the \"duck in a can\" which just serving it to us is a time in itself. A huge can and ceremony of opening is takes to your table. The contents stack marvelously onto your plate in shape of the can, until you demolish it for that perfect bite of lettuce, and perfectly cooked duck. The duck is soft and marinated and cooked to dreamlike consistency. The lettuce is not mushy but not crunchy and the little bit of sweet accents the softness of the duck. Great portions and great flavor.\\n\\nI got my foie gras hamburger. Mine, this was meant for me. Balanced on a bed of greens and a sweet, thick balsamic vinaigrette was a portion of foie gras and not too much boursin cheese. It is rich but not so much that you get a headache, instead you get that perfect balance of pleasure without the sin of a hangover that is heavy, fatty food...I kid you not that the only place I would ever want to be was right there, at that first bite of magic. To accompany were fries fried in duck fat with truffle sea salt. They were slightly crispy, and delicious.\\n\\nDessert tops it all off, and I ordered the chocolate molten cake. It was soft and thick liquid in the middle, a sauce I sucked off the back of my spoon. The perfect end to quite possibly the perfect meal. \\n\\nI was content, I was satisfied, I ordered another beer and felt like I needed to have a cigarette as I\\'ve just had one of the most pleasurable experiences of my life. \\n\\nThe waitress, the entire time, was very attentive, polite, eager to answer our questions, and so gracious when we were leaving. She really helped make it an awesome experience. The prices were slightly high, but definitely not unreasonable for a nice restaurant ($100 or so for everything, not including tip). \\n\\nThis is a place I need to go every time I go to Montreal, even just passing by for an evening. We sent our highest compliments to the chef!!', 5)\n",

And the Food was so much more than i expected.  \\n\\nWe shared Le plateau du Plateau.  It was so amazing (pictures to come).  The shellfish was so fresh - oysters, and clams were great.  They also added a bowl of spicy snails.  I have never had these type of snails (sand snails) other than vietnamese style which is steamed and gingery.  the spicy sauce was great.  \\n\\nAs a main dish, I shared the PDC farcie de foie gras.  It was good, but i don't think it was the best thing i could have had on the menu.  :)  because it was farcie, the meat was a tad dry - i think my friend's regular PDC was better.  \\n\\nAnyway, the canard en conserve is classic, the poutine foie gras is a great sharing dish, and les fleurs de courgette tempura were nice as entree.  \\n\\nNice surprise, at the end of the evening, my friend who could not finish her cote de porc took it to go.  They took it to the back and brought it back in airtight plastic (kinda like the sous-vide bag).  haha \\n\\nOHHH and dessert!!!  I love the pudding chomeur!  it comes piping hot, covered in maple syrup.  Takes you back to your Cabane a Sucre memories!

There has to be a higher wait-staff to customer ratio than any restaurant I have ever been in.  Also, they use a service system I had only experienced in much smaller cafes and such: you have a personal staffer in charge of your dinner, but whenever a dish or drink is ready, whoever is available brings it. This means dishes get to you quickly, fresh and hot. It also means that anyone can respond to your needs: you don\\'t have to flag down \"your\" waiter for a question or request. Consequently, the service was outstanding.\\n\\nOur waiter was very helpful, suggesting a daily special [a variety of sausages and head cheese] and cautioning against two orders of the Tarte de boudin.  So the partner had an hors d\\'oeuvre plate of  sausages, and I had a beet and goat cheese salad [Salade de betteraves et ch\\\\u00e8vre]. It was actually like a cold lasagne of beets and herbs and goat cheese. Excellent, almost a meal in itself.\\n\\nThe Tarte de boudin was amazing. Although it looked something like a small pizza, the crust was a delicate, flaky, pastry crust-- as tasty as i\\'ve had anywhere. in the \"topping\" mix were carmelized onions, mashed potatoes, and slices of the most delicious boudin. One order was more than enough for both of us, and there was no way we could have eaten dessert. \\n\\nI had a glass of Bourgogne Aligote [no California wines here....] and the partner had a Cream Ale. \\n\\nIn total, our bill [with a very generous tip] was less than $60.

Too eager to wait, we went twice on our trip. \\n\\nDAY 1:\\nWe had tarragon bison tongue, followed by their famous trotter, a deep fried pigs leg stuffed with veggies served on a bed of cheese infused mashed potatoes the consistency of cheese pizza, topped with foie gras.

We followed that with their beet/goat cheese salad which could have been a dessert, and it was so rich and so gorgeously presented. (it had beautiful greens and even a little lavender flower bud and then drizzled along side was beet puree.) Obviously our entrees were just as good, he had the PDC meatloaf and I had the PDC Melting Pot a porktastic selection of different meats on top of a bowl of the famous mashed potatoes. \\n\\nWe each had a glass of wine, then went ahead and ordered a $67 bottle of Cote du Rhone, our three apps, two entrees and dessert, the bill came out to about $160.

Perfect from start to finish. One of the owners took our drink orders (not Martin Picard, unfortunately, but extremely nice) and the bread and butter was brought out shortly. Oh, that butter! Even their butter is amazing, obviously from a local, superior source, served with rustic bread. I can only think of one other restaurant (Eleven Madison Park in NYC) where bread and butter were so memorable. We ordered foie gras cromesquis and tomato tartlets for appetizer, both were amazing. Especially cromesquis, I\\'d never had anything like that in my life -- that feeling of warm, intense foie gras flavor exploding in your mouth! Had boudin and foie gras tart and the famous Duck in a Can for entree, again both were AMAZING. Both dishes had SO much foie gras in/on it! Every bite was simply heavenly. Sorry to use such cheesy language, but I have no better way to express it. That Duck in a Can had so many flavors melding together that it was dizzying! And that boudin and foie gras tart with BIG chunks of each strewn all over... it\\'s enough to give me an orgasm now. Even the dessert was amazing (I know, if I say \"amazing\" one more time in this review...) We ordered pudding chomeur, which arrived boiling and smelling intensely of maple syrup! It was sheer torture waiting for it to cool down, but when it did... so simple yet so freakin\\' delicious. I am SO making that for dessert this Christmas. Even though I begged the owner to open a franchise in New York, I\\'m glad there\\'s nothing like that around here. Otherwise I would go there weekly and weigh 400 pounds! Seriously, one of the most amazing meals in my life and all that amazing food for around $150 for two. This is officially one of my favorite restaurants in the WORLD and I canNOT wait to go back!', 5)\n",
      "('If \"Au Pied de Cochon\" were a rock band, it would be Queen circa 1979. And if Chef Marc Picard were a rockstar, he would be a latex-clad, cocaine-snorting, sex-crazed Freddie Mercury. This restaurant is pure rock \\'n roll on a plate. Uncompromising, unhealthy, and unlike anything you\\'ve ever tasted.\\n\\nI had heard about it from my friend in Montreal, and like many others, had drooled in delight at the Bourdain \"No Reservations\" segment filmed at the restaurant. For a serious gourmand, foie gras is up there with caviar, truffles and oysters in the \"leave your pre-conceptions behind\" department. It is also one of the most delectable things on the planet, and Monsieur Picard simply knows how to do it. Right. \\n\\nThere is simply no point in coming to this restaurant if you are not willing to put yourself, and your health, at risk. In all honesty, I would recommend three things:\\n\\n1) A group of friends who love food, and by love I mean ADORE it. They must also love foie gras, specifically.\\n2) A full de-tox the day prior, with perhaps a few pieces of celery to keep the body going. But for God\\'s sake, do not eat a regular meal within the 24 hour window period preceding the pig-out. This is a religious experience, and as such it must be treated with reverence, discipline, and a little fear.\\n3) Start smoking and/or go to the gym on a regular basis, because the only thing that can tame the foie gras coma you will be in is half-a-pack of smokes, or a swift 15-minute walk around the block right before dessert.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we arrived prepared and loaded with cash. The place is expensive, but I am not even going to get into a financial dissection. How much would you pay to see Freddie Mercury live? Exactly. Some things exist beyond crumpled pieces of cash, or faded plastic credit cards. Some things are immortal- like Freddie, or foie gras. The clientele is generally quite youthful- between 25-40. Nobody in their right mind would eat here past 40 without a cardiologist by their side. It\\'s a good space, not huge, with so-so acoustics. Realistically though, you won\\'t have time to talk much since your mouths will be occupied 80-85% of the time. Think of it as a foie gras bordello, with you as the old hooker.\\n\\nSo we began. We ordered a Foie Gras burger; pan-seared Foie Gras; the infamous Duck-in-a-can; the pig\\'s foot; an assortment of vegetables; and an absolutely out-of-this-world bottle of Cotes de Provence. So good, in fact, that we went for the same bottle twice. Of course, we shared everything.\\n\\nThe burger was \"monstrous\". The waiter had warned me, but I was on a suicidal mission and decided to order it as my appetizer. It\\'s basically a lean beef burger doused in a balsamic reduction, with a slab of foie gras on top. The burger buns were crunchy and firm (presumably to hold the whole structure together), and though it needed some serious scaffolding work half-way through, it held together nicely. The whole thing was a knock-out punch to the senses. Strong, aromatic, but surprisingly well thought-out, with the foie gras giving a creamy after taste to each beefy bite. \\n\\nIt is often the simplest dishes that reveal the true artistry in the kitchen, and the quality of ingredients. Please welcome dish numero deux, the pan-seared foie gras- possibly the simplest dish on the menu. Served with garlic crostini and a mild balsamic reduction (notice the trend), the foie gras was crispy on the outside but revealed a molten, sweet center. This is not the kind of foie gras we are often accustomed to- the mousse-like paste to be spread onto bread or toast. This is the liver itself, unprocessed and untainted. Beautiful. \\n\\nBy this point we were starting to feel the calorific after-burn, but the best was yet to come. \\n\\nThe duck-in-a-can is a mechanical marvel. A waiter comes over with a tin can labelled \"canard en conserve\". A deep plate is placed in front of you, and in it is a bed of pillowy mashed potatoes. The waiter then cracks the can open, and pours its content over the mashed potatoes. Magically, the mashed potatoes are joined by half a mallard duck, jus, foie gras, garlic, balsamic demi-glaze and other heavenly ingredients. There are literally are no words to describe the richness and exquisite taste. Comparing it to anything I\\'d previously eaten would border on criminal.\\n\\nSimilarly, the pied de cochon  is a delicate oven-roasted miracle stuffed with foie gras. It was at this point that my friend and I looked at each other and realized that we were born in the wrong century. In our food-fuelled daze, we saw each other as feudal lords, or kings, feasting on pig, engorged liver and wine, loving every second of it. The restaurant is essentially a time-warp to the land of gluttony. If Henry VIII were alive, he would have a permanent reservation in the back. \\n\\nLife is short, cholesterol is over-rated, and ducks are generally unimpressive creatures with little-to-no personality. Raise your glass to Monsieur Picard, and rock \\'n roll.', 5)\n",

Small cozy bistro with heavenly delicious food, not with fancy deco, but a sincere attitude toward the food. I admire them. The wine list is relatively short, but the guy who took our order (I think he is Phil) recommended a very good Burgundy to our poutine; It's not an expensive selection, but it was good match. Their service was also attentive; we never had to ask for something; their staff really took a good care of us! Excellent orchestrated piece!\", 5)\n",

Les crosmesquis de foie gras was out of this world! It was a foie gras explosion in your mouth. The duck in a can, scary but unbelievably tasty.

OMG amazing!, I just can't see myself eating the duck skin... it was pretty thick...\\n\\nTip: (1) Reservation is a must (2) Sit at the bar, the first 4 seats are awesome, you see all the action in the kitchen!

It is a must visit and truely one of the unique experiences of Montreal.\\n\\nOne thing I loved about it is, its not so uppity about itself, in fact it's almost casual.  It truly is the temple of foie gras, duck and pork that all the Bourdain's have made it out to be.  Which is in fact a wonderful thing.\\n\\nWhen I went recently I shared the pigs head with someone else, just cause, where and when else are you going to get to order a pigs head?  It was awesome but next time I would prob stick to the smaller plates to get more of a sampling.  The chicharron and the fries are fried in duck fat.  You must get these.

Everything about it was incredible. We also ordered a side of fries that were fried in duck fat- not really my thing, but I can see why it would appeal to others.

      "(\"The foie gras poutine is worth the visit alone. I love the fact that this place isn't pretentious -- it's egalitarian in the sense that you don't have to be some sort of snobby foodie to enjoy yourself. I was comfortable in jeans and sneakers. (Granted, I had to wear jeans with a loose waistband, because by the time I left, I was practically popping out). \\n\\nWe started with the foie gras poutine and a salad, which seems odd given the rest of the menu. But the salad was topped with rabbit and a deep fried soft egg. Very good.\\n\\nI had the Duck in a Can, which arrived around twenty minutes after our appetizer plates were taken away. Included a giant chunk of duck breast, foie gras, and fat. Love the fat. Only weakness was the puree and bread the canned duck was emptied out onto -- I was hoping for more of a mashed potato, it tasted more like sunchoke or parsnip with cabbage. \\n\\nMy husband had the beef rib, which looked like something Fred Flintstone ordered in the opening credits of the Flintstones (y'know, at the drive in movie theatre, where the server places it on the car tray and the car tips over?). You'd think a hunk of rib that gigantic would be tough and sinewy, but quite the opposite -- it was so tender and nom-tastic. \\n\\nI wish I'd left room for dessert, but after all that foie gras and fat, I felt like I was going to keel over and die. (From happiness as well as fullness.)\\n\\nThe only crappy thing was that we had a 9pm reservation and we weren't seated until 9:40. The hostess was really nice about it, though - she offered us something to drink and was very apologetic. Once we were seated, it wasn't that long until we received our appetizers.

      "(\"unapologetically and obscenely decadent. this is a pilgrimage that every lover of foie gras and all things pork should make at least once in their lifetime. it is everything that you would expect: the experience of ingredients so dripping with awesome that even large, burly dudes suddenly begin to fear for the future state of their arteries. just like it sounds guys, dripping with awesome. \\ni don't remember anything of the fine wine which we drank on that day except that it was red, and it was good, and there was a lot of it. A shot of whiskey prior to the meal is encouraged, like an offering to the gods and an act of submission. and the laughter, amazement, and groans of pleasure with each course is a part of the pied de cochon experience, just about the best part of this restaurant, and the reason why it was worth every single solitary calorie.\\nso onto the food. we began our journey with an order of the foie gras cromesquis: three cubes of the most delicious liquid foie you've ever known. piping hot when they arrive at the table, the waiter warned that we should wait two minutes prior to consumption and consume in one big bite. my bite was ecstasy- breaking into the outer fried crust gave way to straight up hot liquid pleasure. If you don't start out with this appetizer, you'll deeply regret it. other dishes following this bite were also wonderful, although the star of the other three we ordered was the guinea hen liver mousse. a creamy fuschia-toned concoction arrives at the table, neatly packed in a small jar, and sealed with a layer of fat. pickled onions and a sweet shot glass of jelly are meant to top your spread of liver on crisped baguette slices. it was a perfect little appetizer to share, right down to the last bite. the piglet roast, thin slices of loin topped with a luscious sauce of confit of tuna mixed into mayonnaise, was excellent, as were the slices of tangy, tender pickled tongue with spicy mustard. \\nand so after a couple bathroom breaks (note the strategically placed tv in the restroom: so thoughtful) and a little more wine, arrived the entrees. the best of the three we ordered? the duck in the can. i don't need to wax poetic on how a savory mess out of a can can be so remarkably delicious. the perfectly cooked, medium rare duck breast combined with a generous slice of foie, and an unsuspectingly delicious concoction of cooked shredded cabbage was memorable to say the least. its arrival at the table is an event, and that first bite of duck, foie, cabbage, and a bit of the toast and puree below is one of those euphoric events that is never forgotten, and sought after for the rest of your culinary expeditions. our other excellent entrees included the foie gras duo, and the boudin and foie gras tart. the foie gras duo includes both the foie gras poutine and the foie gras burger. the poutine was wonderful, comfort food elevated to ridiculousness. that creamy foie gras rich gravy is unforgettable. the burger is the obscene part. sloppy, difficult to consume, but you will try! oh how you will try! after consuming a quarter of the burger, i recall my dining companions desperately trying to pick at pieces of lettuce, desperate for vegetables after the onslaught of fatty tummy saturation...whatever that means. the boudin tart was also good, though i think it was the redheaded step child of the group of entrees. still great, but overshadowed by the other two, and maybe a little heavy on the mustard. but i do love anything with boudin... i'd put it on my ice cream if i didn't gross people out so much.\\nkeeling over from happiness, we felt obligated to order one dessert, and opted for their maple syrup hot pot cake. i honestly can't remember what the hell this was called. but i do know that it was sugary, warm, melt in your mouth wonderful. just ask for a dessert that would fit that description. i assure you that the wait staff, perhaps the most amiable i've ever encountered, will be happy to oblige.\\nmy goodness, i can't say enough. i, like you, have had a lot of bad meals in my life, lots of hype followed by some sunken-shoulder disappointment. this was not one of those meals. did it exceed my expectations? nope. i expected heaven, and i got it. to recap, make sure you order the foie gras comesquis, the guinea hen liver mousse, the duck in the can, and the maple syrup hot pot thing. ask lots of questions, and just enjoy yourself. and pass out afterwards with happy thoughts of ducks and pigs that died for a good cause. i love this restaurant.\", 5)\n",

Great atmosphere and a gorgeous summer night in April. The resaurant's front was completely opened which allowed light breeze and created a lovely backdrop for dinner. It's a quality restaurant that could easily be pretentious but doesn't carry itself to be that way at all. \\n\\nAs recommended by bloggers and yelp reviews, foie gras poutine and duck in a can were a must. Sometimes you wonder if it's hype or buzz  but truly this is so worth it. Foie gras poutine - thick cut fries, foie gras, cheese curds and gravy. Best poutine EVER! The flavour of each of these ingredients stands out on it's own but compliment each other well. I've been trying to go dairy free; it's moments like this where I realize how much I love cheese and where I kick myself for giving it up. It's an appetizer, so a smaller portion; great for sharing. Makes sense though given the generosity of the entree portions. My two girlfriends' ordered starter salads and were dismayed at how big they were.\\n\\nDUCK-IN-A-CAN gets a paragraph for itself. Duck is my favourite and cooking it in a can was the best thing that could have happened to it. Picture a generous portion of duck breast with its fatty skin in a can. It keeps all of its flavour and fatty juices contained, also soaking up the flavours from cabbage, foie gras, thyme and sauces. They bring it out and open the can at your table, pouring it over toasted bread and mashed potatoes. It sounds simple, but it's anything but. I don't even think I participated in conversation for about 10-15 minutes. My friends were talking to me and I was in hazy bliss.\\n\\nI cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal and how devasted I was when something so yummy had to end.

In addition, it came with escargot in a black bean sauce, conch, mussels with a nice tomato broth, fancy mini melon balls in the raw oysters, sea jelly?!? in some fancy oysters, calamari with delicious aoli, a skewer of lightly fried white fish, some truly amazing scallops.)\\n-Lamb Shank (perfectly cooked, wanted more and more- huge portion!)\\n-Foie gras tart with blood sausage (SO SO GOOD. light puff pastry topped with caramelized onions, creamy melt in your mouth foie gras, with bites of sausage. big enough to share for two!)\\n\\nThe bill with beers ended up being way cheaper than I thought I was going to spend going in.  The portions were generous and the quality of the food was tremendous.  I encourage trying anything on the foie gras menu because you probably won't find better preparations then here.  No wonder this is one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite spots. This will definitely be a part of any future trips to Montreal!\", 5)\n",
      "(\"So delicious.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was delicious here.  I had a glass of bordeaux, and with a group of 5 other friends, split a meal of foie gras poutine, a bison rib, duck in a can, pig's feet, and probably more I'm forgetting.  Even the fries were delicious -- crisp and savory.  \\n\\nThe only down side is that everything was so filling (and fatty) not only did I not want to stay out and get my drink on on Saint-Laurent, when I got up in the morning I was still full, with that little reflux burp you get after a rich meal.  \\n\\nSo I highly recommend it, but either eat light or don't make any plans for afterward.\", 5)\n",
      "(\"I first heard about this place through a friend who had invited me to his birthday dinner at this place.  I hadn't heard too much about it prior to this but when I saw how packed the place was even at 11pm at night, I knew that there had to be something special about this place.   \\n\\nDecor wise, there was nothing particularly fancy: modern rustic - it felt like you wanted to be there to eat-- and eat we did.\\n\\nStarters: \\n-the table (of 8) shared an entire foiegras that was pan fried and then doused in some cheese sauce and served with a baguette.  Pretty amazing.\\n- french onion soup Au Pied De Cochon (APDC) style. Hands down the best french onion soup I've ever had.  the reason: BACON/Pork Chunks.\\n- foie gras poutine.  Sounds weird but it works.  For those uneducated in Quebecois cuisine, Poutine is a dish comprised of french fries, cheese curds and gravy.  APDC just added foie gras to the mix and BAM, heaven in your mouth and a punch to your arteries.\\n\\nMain course:\\n- I got the Duck in a Can which is their take on a Duck confit but of course, with Foie gras (do you see an underlying theme at this restaurant?) which they somehow cook and then stuff it in a can and then open it at your table on top of a dish of celery root puree.  \\n\\nNeedless to say i did not make it to dessert but I was feeling more than satisfied with every bit of my meal.\\n\\nI've been back since and always tend to over eat.  Their Foie Gras stuffed pig's foot is something to try too.   I'd probably share some dishes next time i go but DEfinitely go if you enjoy food.

      "(\"It's a little difficult to be original when there are well over 100 prior reviews of the same restaurant, but I will say that this place is on my short list of favorite restaurants of all time.  My one gripe about this restaurant, which I will get off my chest is that they give you an end time with your reservation.  Although I didn't expect to go beyond my 2-hour block, I found it a little off-putting.\\n\\nAs for the food.  My wife and I ordered three things.  The tomato tartlet,  ploque de Champlain, and duck in a can.  Although the tartlet was nicely crisp, with juicy tomatoes, it wasn't worth the space in my stomach compared to the other two dishes.\\n\\nThe ploque de champlain was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   It was sorta like a breakfast food but to the most extreme.  It contained stack of a pancake, potatoes, bacon, seared foie gras, and overflowing with maple syrup.  Truly memorable.  \\n\\nWhile gimmicky, the duck in a can, which comes with like a half a duck, a huge lobe of foie gras and other assorted bits in a rich brown sauce, and poured tableside over celery root puree is phenomenal.  Perhaps it wasn't the smartest thing to order after the ploque de champlain because it was excessively rich.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, we ordered the pudding chomeur, which had a seared caramelized top with an inside was served so scorching hot, it burned the roof of my mouth.  Not surprisingly, it was very sweet and very rich.\\n\\nNext time I make my way back to Montreal, I want to go for some of the raw bar, which looked extremely fresh.\\n\\nThis place caters to serious eaters that are open to trying new things.  I wouldn't recommend taking someone who has any food phobias.  I would also recommend eating something very light earlier in the day since your gall bladder will be working on overdrive after you've finished your meal.\\n\\nOverall, the meal cost roughly $60/person, which I thought was pretty reasonable considering the amazing food experience.\", 5)\n",

PDC two nights in a row!\\n\\nIt's hard to pick the pinnacle of the meals... was it when we were served a pig's head, with a lobster in the pig's mouth?  or perhaps it was one of the many astounding foie gras dishes... or maybe the two 'ducks in a can' that we got as takeaway food, to eat after we'd gone home from Montreal.\\n\\nPDC is advertised as being a great place for lovers of pork, foie gras and shellfish, and it does what it says on the box.\", 5)\n",
      "('Ok this review is about 7 months late, but I still remember it like it was yesterday. The Boy had taken me to Mont Tremblant for a skiing trip for my belated Graduation present and Christmas present. On our trip, we stayed in Montreal our first night across the border. I had read many times over on websites that this place was the place to go for great Canadian-French cuisine so I thought this was the perfect place to try my first authentic French meal. Boy, they were not lying! I\\'ll admit I did not know really anything about French food prior to this trip so I asked the waitress for her recommendations which she gladly gave in her thick French accent. We started off with the cromesquis with foie gras appetizer which is basically this tiny pastry thingy filled with hot, liquid foie gras that explodes in your mouth. It exploded so well that I think some of it came out of my boyfriends mouth, oh! We also ordered an appetizer of marinated smoked sausages that Boy just had to try. Next, for our main course we split the infamous \"Duck in a Can\" entree as well as the Beef tartar with a side of fries cooked in duck fat! The tartar was great but the duck was PHENOMENAL. Even though I am pretty sure I contributed heavily to my LDL count in this one meal, I must say that it is one of the most delicious and mind blowing food experiences I\\'ve ever had! It has opened me up to the world of French cuisine! I can\\'t wait to eat here again when I come back for another skiing trip. It was my favorite meal the entire time I was in Canada. If you\\'re ever in Montreal, do not miss the opportunity to have a food revelation like I did at this neighborhood gem!', 5)\n",

The food was superb with artful presentations served in a warm, inviting and modern atmosphere. The stars of this menu are the Foie Gras & Pork dishes but everything we tried was atleast excellent with some plates reaching perfection.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nStarters - \\n\\nFresh Warm Bread & Butter- A great start to our meal. The bread was thickly sliced with a crispy crust and soft interior. This ame with cold butter.\\n\\nBeef Tartare - I loved this dish. The presentation was perfect as it was served in 2 Sushi-style \"Temaki\" nori hand rolls with crispy onion shoe strings, warm rice, lucious beef tartare topped with a quail egg in it\\'s shell with sesame seeds on top. You poured the quail egg and sesame seed mix on top. I couldn\\'t get over the marriage of flavors. It was devine.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nDuck In A Can - Medium rare Duck, Foie Gras, Thyme & Balsamic Jus served over Mashed Potatoes & Toast. The presentation was whimsical as our server used a can opener tableside and spun the contents of the cooked can over a plate of Mashed potatoes over toast. The flavors were nearly perfect. I loved everything about this plate with the only exception being that the duck skin was a little rubbery and gelatinous instead of crispy. Otherwise it was sublime.\\n\\nPork Chop with Red Cabbage & Onions - My wife ordered this and it didn;t disappoint. This dish was simple in presentation but big on flavor. I loved the balnce of red cabbage and onions with the moist chop. It really elevated thedistinct and smoky flavor of the pork.\\n\\nSide:\\n\\nFrites cooked in Duck Fat - These were without a doubt the best fries I\\'ve ever had. Simply amazing. Served in a paper cone with a side of mayonnaise. The fries were crisp on the outside and hot and soft in the center. We skipped the mayonnaise and dipped them in the jus from our entrees. These paired with the Duck In A Can beautifully.\\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nDark Chocolate Pot de Creme - I love dark chocolate and I love dessert. This was a warm chocolate pudding topped with whipped creme and buttery cake crumbs served in a jar. It was rich and decadent.\\n\\nVanilla Bean Ice Cream - We paired this with out Pot de Creme and it provided the perfect balance of flavor and temperature. It was the perfect end to our meal @ APDC.\\n\\nOverall we had a wonderful time @ APDC. It was without a doubt the most relaxing, fun and enjoyable fine dining experience I\\'ve ever had. This is not light fare but certainly delicous, thoughtful and stellar food presented in a casual environment. Count me in as a now devoted fan of chef Martin Picard. Merci Beaucoup Chef.', 5)\n",

While we had some issues with our reservation in the beginning, and the hostess was extremely rude, this was more than offset by the service at the table, which was friendly and very quick. I'm not going to go into too much detail about the food because I think the other reviews speak for themselves, but I'm just going to say flat-out that this was the best meal of my life (and all of my friends felt the same way).  I had the Poutine au foie gras and the classic Canard en conserve (Duck in a can), followed by the Pouding ch\\\\u00f4meur for dessert. Most of us ordered different entrees, but we were all in agreement that the Duck in a can was second to none. Very indulgent and fatty food but an unforgettable experience.

      "('I was intrigued when I heard that Au Pied de Cochon was one of Anthony Bourdain\\'s favorite restaurants. Given that the restaurant\\'s name means \"At the Pig\\'s Foot\", I\\'m not surprised as Mr. Bourdain is known for his infatuation of all things pork. However, the restaurant is about more than pork; it\\'s about indulging in all things rich and comforting. The main menu is filled with a meaty assortment of pork, beef, and duck dishes (vegetarians need not enter). Foie gras even has its own section as a \"meat\" with over 10 menu items...a foie gras lover\\'s dream! \\n\\nThe restaurant has a lively yet laid-back feel. It is non-descript (no sign outside) but full of warmth as sunlight from the large windows and skylights cast a glow on the honey-colored wood throughout the dining room. The staff also provided excellent service in an easygoing manner. It was good to be in such a comfortable environment as I let go and ate myself senseless...\\n\\nFoie Gras Poutine - poutine is to Canada as what chili-cheese fries are to the South. Up here, the Canadians top french fries with gravy and cheese curds...and Chef Picard then takes it one step further by adding a velvety slab of foie gras on top of it all. The gravy on this poutine was ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING! I don\\'t know if I can adequately describe it...imagine a gravy that\\'s thick, buttery, warm, creamy, and oh-so-savory, then multiply that goodness by 1,000. I cant\\' get over how good it was! Needless to say, I did not leave a single drop of gravy on the plate. \\n\\nPlogue \\\\u00e0 Champlain - deliciously addictive! This dish consisted of a buckwheat pancake topped with cheese, potatoes, thick-cut bacon, and foie gras. And on top of that was Quebec maple syrup, chopped apples, and parsley. The contrasting sweet and savory flavors were in perfect harmony. It was like having dinner and dessert wrapped up in an exceptionally decadent bite! [I\\'m literally salivating as I write about this!] \\n\\nSeafood Platter - the restaurant had a huge display of fresh/live seafood, so I thought it\\'d be a good idea to \"balance\" our heavy courses with a seafood platter...little did I know it\\'d be a gigantic mound of seafood! It was a heaping assortment of stuffed mussels, conch, razor clams, calamari, cherrystone clams, oysters, and even bowl of periwinkles sauteed in black bean sauce. Prepared with a number of different sauces and marinades, this was much more elaborate than the typical raw seafood platter. It\\'s now clear why this dish wasn\\'t served first. I did find all this seafood to be overwhelming though, and would have rather had the option to choose a few seafood items from the menu instead. \\n\\nDark Chocolate Pot de Cr\\\\u00e8me - Luckily, I always have an extra stomach for dessert so I didn\\'t miss out on this luscious chocolatey goodness. It was so scrumptious with the graham cracker crumbles\\n\\nThe restaurant also served this terrific spearmint green tea by Kusmi. I liked it so much that I found it online and ordered some afterwards. Too bad I can\\'t have that orgasmic poutine and plogue shipped to me as well.

Main course: duck in a can, terrific, still don't understand how they make this dish and keep it warm serving at the table. The special that day they had a whole rabbit, that i shared with my daughter, very good. For desert we enjoyed chocolate pot and a pear with ice cream.

I really wish we had ordered more of this appetizer because it is simply divine! Heaven on a plate for sure. \\n\\nThen it was onto our 5 main dishes we all split: DUCK IN A CAN was definitely the winner. It was also the priciest  canned food I have ever eaten which would bring canned food drives to a whole new level! They cook the duck and foie gras and sauce and onions before hand, seal it in a can and when you order it for $35 they heat up the whole can on the stove, bring it to your table with a can opener and open it and plop it on a plate! My tastebuds hadn't been happier. That sauce you literally wanted to mop up with anything else leftover on the table. \\n\\nThe pied du cochon or the pigs feet stuffed with foie gras was awesome too and I thought that one would have grossed me out for sure! Again that sauce was bangin! And the beef tartare was definitely refreshing and lighter in feeling than any of the other dishes we had especially when wrapped up as a lettuce wrap! Their happy stew is not for you if you don't like blood sausage because there is a huge healthy portion of that in here but it is pretty darn flavorful. And the loser of the entrees but still pretty good was the lamp and lentils dish. Just didn't quite excite our tastebuds like the other dishes.\\n\\nAnd if that wasn't enough, we officially all had muffin tops over our pants when we ordered the creme brulee that was fire toasted with a brand of the restaurant on top!

The restaurant itself is cozy and the simple decor reminded me a lot of Avec in Chicago.  I also love that APDC maintains a fairly casual atmosphere.  There is nothing better than eating delicious food at a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously, even if the food is seriously great.  A major factor which attributes to APDC earning a 5 star rating is their service. Everybody, from the hostess to our waiter to the various running staff here, were so delightfully pleasant and so attentive.  I immediately felt an affinity towards the awesomeness of my fellow Canadians.\\n\\nOn to the eats:\\n\\nBeef Tartare\\nI really liked the presentation on APDC's beef tartare. For a second I thought I was in a sushi restaurant but a beef tartare hand roll makes for a scrumptious appetizer.  \\n\\nTomato Tartlet\\nI'm guessing that this is the name of the dish as this was the only tomato anything I saw on the menu.  We ordered this dish since it seemed like every table around us had ordered it.  I love me some tomatoes and this dish was refreshingly tasty.  The pesto in the olive oil combined with what I'm guessing to be crumbled mascarpone was a perfect complement in this dish.\\n\\nClams\\nThis has got to be the best clam dish I've had.  Perfectly steamed in the most delicious creamy sauce that had a slight taste of parmesan. I'm salivating just thinking about it. \\n\\nDuck in a can \\nThe presentation is quite fun to watch.  While all the components of this dish are prepared well, the first few bites were great and then it became savory overload for me.  But that's just my taste, my boyfriend quite enjoyed the dish overall. \\n\\nFoie Gras Poutine\\nMy favorite of the evening.  I love poutine!  I only wish I could find some in socal.  APDC had the best gravy for their poutine that I've ever had. And the foie gras was like morsels of special yumminess in each bite. \\n\\nPoached Pear with Vanilla Ice Cream\\nWhen this dessert was delivered to our table, we thought, wow - that really IS a poached pear.  But it was the most refreshing dessert that I've ever had.  The vanilla ice cream was a perfect complement to the pear which was fresh and juicy.  \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come to APDC again the next time I go to Montreal.

Wonderful... but nothing comparted to the one the server recommended to us, which was a spectacular blend of Foie Gras with canadian bacon, sour cream and cheese on a pancake, topped with maple syrup.  Holy Jesus!!!!!  When you put that in your mouth, prepare to be blown away.  What a combination of flavors.  \\n\\nI didn't think anything could beat that, and maybe it didn't, but the rest of the food was also amazing.  And finally, the dessert.  Wow.

You know when you have had something so great it left you speechless, well this was it!  We had a large group so we ordered everything off the menu and shared.  Everything was fantastic, so I will review the highlights of my meal!\\n\\nDuck in a can-ingenious, how they stuff a duck in a can, close the lid off and cook it in the can.  The waiter then opens up the can in front of you and displays it on the plate.  Juicy, packing tons of flavor!\\n\\nPig's feet with foie gras.  Meat was unbelievably tender, mixed with foie gras, over a bed of potatoes.  This plate is enormous, so it can definitely be shared.  A must try!  I still think about it to this day!\\n\\n\\n\\nPossibly one of the best meals I have ever had, no doubt at all!   Bourdain definitely hit the spot on this place!  I would visit Montreal just to eat at APDC!\", 5)\n",
      "(\"Had to get duck in a can, it's unique and original and I don't know of a place in my own country where I can get it.  Bottom line, this place is a carnivore's paradise and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal.\", 5)\n",
      "(\"I will be back to Montreal to just visit this restaurant. I've read the reviews and was very curious to try it and I have to admit it is really worth all its hype. AND! This comes from someone who hated foie gras before going there! \\n\\nAs many have noted below, you have to make reservations in advance, I would suggest to call them as soon as you know that you will be going to Montreal. We called a week in advance and the earliest spot they had was 10.30 p.m. on a Sunday night. We got there at 9.30 and they said that we could eat at the bar if we don't want to wait for our 10.30 reservation, we agreed and it was so much fun! You can actually see the cooking process because of the open kitchen, it was a really great experience. That said -- it's by no means a romantic spot. Atmosphere is very cool - it's crowded, noisy and  fun! Service is great and friendly.  Food is OUTSTANDING to say the least. Very unusual combination of flavors! The food is very rich, but honestly, I didn't feel stuffed/sick after I had appetizers, main course and dessert. It was a nice, delicious and very memorable dinner.\\n\\nWe had pickled tongue and  duck carpaccio as appetizers which were beyond amazing. Duck carpaccio comes with raw egg on top which you mix with dijon mustard right on the plate - very different and soooo good! My boyfriend had duck in a can, which was terrific - he saved the can as a souvenir! I had Plogue a Champlain - pancake with potatoes, bacon, cheddar and foie gras topped with maple syrop - it was absolutely amazing. Even though  it was a little too sweet for my taste, I was very happy with the flavors. Desserts were very good too! I also thought it was really affordable, the bill was under $150 for dinner for two with wine, apps and two desserts - pretty good!\\n\\nForget about this place if you:\\n-count calories \\n-are vegetarian\\n-don't eat certain foods\\n-are looking for a quiet romantic dinner\\n\\nFor any foodie, this place is a MUST to say the least. I just came back from Montreal and am already thinking when I should go again to try something new on their menu :)\", 5)\n",

      "('What can I say that hasn\\'t already been said about this incredible altar to excess and indulgence?  \\n\\nI read most of these reviews and looked at all the pictures to best plan out my first meal.  From the get go I wanted to ensure that I had a whole meal from beginning to end\\n\\nSo to start I strategically had the \"Cromesquis de foie gras\" (aka dried cubes of FG that pop in your mouth when you eat them!!) along side the \"Salade de Bleu, pommes, endives\" which could have been an entire meal all in itself.  Huge chunks of pungent blue cheese, walnuts and a creamy dressing was a great way to start.\\n\\nAfter that I had the \"Canard en conserve\"...how could I not after all the pictures and reviews?  It was my first time there and I wanted to go with a real winner.  Its everything everybody says about it and more.  From presentation to texture to flavor all I can say is YES\\n\\nDesert was perfect way to cap off such a intense meal.  I chose to go with the \"Poire poch\\\\u00e9e et glace vanille \" wich I was (pleasantly) surprised to find was served cold and it capped off things nicely.\\n\\nMy final Top Tip would be to leave the car at home and forget about the taxi...jump on the subway to get to the restaurant.  The walk back to the station at the end of the meal will do you some good!', 5)\n",
      "(\"This is a definite place to visit while in Montreal. Plan to linger at your table after a meal here. The food is so amazingly rich with outstanding flavor. I have never quite had anything like this cusine before. We enjoyed Tomatoe Tartlet and beef tartare for our appetizer. I enjoyed the Nova Scotia swordfish with artichoke hearts. Ramzi enjoyed the foie gras poutine. Poutine is a dish consisting of french fries, cheese curds, brown gravy, and topped with other ingredients. In Ramzi's case, he chose to top the poutine with Foir Gras. The restaurant has a bustling feel but still quaint enough to feel relaxed. Service took a bit long, but the service staff still very friendly.\", 5)\n",

With the apple jelly to go with it, I felt like I did not need to eat anything for a long time:  I did not want the taste to go away.\\n\\nThe melting pot provided a \"kitchen sink\" approach to the pig:  sausage, blood sausage, a hunk of pork (like a chop kind of meat), and a lardy thing with cheesy mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  Wow.  I did my best, but wound up having to leave the blood sausage only half eaten.  The server said it was okay, no one was judging me on how much I ate.  This hearty meal, while seeming excessive, sat well with me.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation really came through.\\n\\nI will return to Montreal, and come here to celebrate.', 5)\n",

      "(\"I must give great thanks to my friend Mike, who made this experience possible. Going to Montreal has been one my best experiences in life thus far. APC was just amaaazing. My first time having foie gras and it was delicious. I wish that I had been more adventurous and gotten the duck in a can, however my wallet was doing the thinking so I ordered the steak frites, which as good. My friend ordered the Melting Pot which had close to everything but the oink of the pig and he was in Hog Heaven. My other friend had the duck breast in red wine I believe, and he thoroughly enjoyed his plate. I thoroughly enjoyed nibbling from both plates, though I stayed away from the blood sausage in the melting pot. \\n\\nWhat really got me though was the desert, gosh that was heaven.

      "(\"While most restaurants that I've been too in my various trips to Montreal have been generally very good, few have set a culinary standard that my visit to Au Pied de Cochon has. I had not been there on the two previous trips but after hearing even more hype about it, decided to make it happen last weekend while in Quebec. I had made a reservation almost two months before the date of the dinner and it was rather easy, done right over the phone. Just a day before the dinner, the restaurant called me to confirm it.\\n\\nI must admit that I had been looking forward to it for a while after salivating over the menu on their website. One thing that I did notice was how authentic it was; how well it reflected not just the local ingredients, but also the approach and tradition of the Province of Quebec. Anyone reading the menu should easily be able to determine the type of food that you'll be experience and in this case it's rather easy. It features dishes that are somewhat on the fatty but yet very tasty side, something that has helped the locals survive the harsh winters. Some of their proteins offered are bison, beef and also a lot of duck dishes as well. Duck as a matter of fact is their specialty - the culprit dish is duck in a can ($37): a duck breast, a piece of foie gras, some balsamic glaze, some garlic and some thyme, all sealed into a custom-labeled tin can and cooked to perfection. The dish is revealed tableside and is poured from the can and into your plate and the can placed onto the table next to your plate.  But enough on that and more about what I actually ordered and ate.\\n\\nAfter taking a good look at the categorized menu, whose dishes are sorted by protein-type, I decided, after much hesitation to get the assiette de cochonailles (pork charcuterie plate). It featured some pickled tongue, three large portions of delicious p\\\\u00e2t\\\\u00e9, some headcheese, some pork sausage and even some aspic. On the plate were also half of a hardboiled egg and some corn salsa. At $9.50, it was probably the single greatest value I've ever seen and having eaten most of it, I was already almost full. Everything was great although I was not a big fan of the tongue that I found too pungent - The bread was perfectly toasted and I think that the highlight of the dish was the p\\\\u00e2t\\\\u00e9 which was out-of-this-world. Not having any idea as to the portion sizes, I was actually going to order more food as their starters seemed very appetizing and were very affordable - their zucchini blossoms ($6) and their foie gras croquemis ($3.50) caught my attention but the waiter told me that I had already enough food in my order, especially since my main course was going to be one of their specials, their lamb shank. \\n\\nSpeaking of the lamb shank, it arrived shortly after and was cooked to perfection; it fell of the bone and was perfectly seasoned. That explained why they didn't upgrade my knife at the table while all six others at the table had been given steak knifes. I didn't need a knife at all; it was fork-tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of green lentils and at only $26, was a bargain considering the volume of the serving and the quality of the food. It was cooked confit-style and was had some tomato on top. It was all delicious and ever so tender, even the lentils were cooked perfectly. I could barely finish it all but somehow managed. In the process, I also sampled some of my friends dishes, as I stated earlier, including the duck in a can and the cassoulet. Both were very tasty dishes and the duck was very flavorful, picking up some of the foie gras flavors in the process. \\n\\nWe did not have room for desserts but all left very satisfied from our food and drinks - Most of us ordered local beers, including their delicious 'Au Pied de Cochon' ale which is brewed in Quebec. It was light, came ice cold and paired well with our meal. The service and kitchen were a bit slow but the service was very, very efficient and although our meal lasted over two and a half hours, our time spent there was amazing. Our waiter even tracked and split our checks into seven individual tabs at the end of the meal which was both impressive and pretty awesome. Saved us from a math-induced headache.\\n\\nThe d\\\\u00e9cor is simple and the restaurant doesn't even have it's name in the front and yet it's warm and welcoming. The tables are a bit cramped and the restaurant isn't very wide, but you're able to use a self-serve coat check upon entering before being showed to your table. This restaurant is an absolute gem in a city which already has good food, it excels at reflecting the true colors of Quebec through its menu and dishes. Just remember though, reservations are a must, and should be done way ahead of time. I cannot wait to go back in the future and experience more of their food.\", 5)\n",
      "(\"Ate at the PDC back in September and it was absolutely incredible. Had to make reservations a couple months ahead of time but definitely worth it. And I recommend that you make reservations as soon as you figure out when you're going to Montreal. Our reservations were at 7:30 and I over heard the waitress tell some walk-ins that they MIGHT be able to get them in for 10pm...at the bar. Portions are enormous. My boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers: Crispy PDC salad and Piglet Roast, one entree: PDC melting pot - this had mashed potatoes, blood sausage, homemade pork sausage, and porkloin, and a dessert: Creme brulee, and we were stuffed til the next day. You definitely do not need to get your own dish. Plus, sharing is caring! \\n\\nAs for the service; surprisingly super friendly and efficient especially for such a busy restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Quite unfortunate some people had a bad time here. This place has been consistently busy since they have opened, obviously they are doing something right.\", 5)\n",

      "(\"By now you know what you're in for when you reserve (weeks in advance!) a table here. Bacon, sausage, duck fat, fois gras, pigs feet, more duck fat, etc. But everything is done spectacularly well-- the wild chef indeed. The fat doesn't escape the food in a way that would leave your plate, fingers, napkin soaked through. It's fattening sure, but it's not greasy. Thoughtful and flavourful, this food is that perfectly tender, melt-in-your mouth fare that it's all hyped up to be. \\n\\nConsidering how upscale the ingredients are and presentation is, you'd expect to pay more but the price is actually quite more than reasonable. Started with the cromesquis (bited sized squares of hot and runny duck fat encapsulated in deep fried batter-- get one, get two!!), indulged in duck in a can (topped with the biggest chunk of fois I've ever seen) and split a bottle of red, all for under $65. There's no needs for sides. I'm completely boggled that some people order french fries on the side of their pieds de cochons. The portions are massive and there's no looks when you order a doggy bag. \\n\\nService for me was fast and the staff was hospitable without being annoying. \\n\\nThis place is regularly touted as the best restaurant in Montreal, and I'm right there with those that proclaim it as such. This place is single-handedly rewriting the history of quebec gastronomie. A MUST.\", 5)\n",
      "(\"Yeah, this is an experience in food, one you shouldn't pass up unless you're a vegetarian, can't eat pork or duck, or simply not into foie gras. This place though, has so many creative takes on good high end foie gras that results into one thing, good. Plain and simple. I like poutines, they're alright. But I thought I'd enjoy them best when I'm plastered at 3 in the morning. This place though, thank you so much Martin, took it to a different level, Foie Gras Poutine. Travesty? Nope, it was the best dish among the Beef Tartare, Duck in a Can, and Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce we ordered. Not to say the other dishes weren't good. They were superb. But the flavors in the poutines went so well together I thought it was the best. Weird eh? Go try it out for yourself.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back to try out the other dishes.

      "(\"So over the top without jumping the shark. The son and I went on our Tour De Food au Montreal. We were impressed. We sat in front of the chefs at the bar (you might find the heat intolerable; we took off our top layers) and watched food in preparation and got asked about how we were digging on the fried smelts served in a ball jar with a dollop of spicy aoli at the bottom, a seasonal special. Next was the well-known, and maybe a little notorious Foie Gras Poutine. And if we hadn't gotten enough foie gras in that dish, it was in the next two. Is fat the official food of Montreal? Or foie gras? We duck in a can - with foie gras! And a dish with a name I forgot that consisted of a buckwheat crepe, melted cheese, potatoes, foie gras (No! Really?), some charcuterie, all topped with some maple syrup-based sauce. It was all amazing and all of it a revelation. \\n\\nDessert was an amazing ice cream soda, with maple syrup, seltzer, a half-cup of stout and maple ice cream, all constructed at your seat by you and your server. \\n\\nDrinks were the house draft beer and shots of Jack  Daniels flavored with maple syrup. \\n\\nDecor, service, excellent. Noise was not so bad. For the two of us: $178 CAD with tip. Yeah, the food is pricey, but this is pricey food. Foie gras, maple products, charcuterie, and duck should be expensive.\", 5)\n",

I never write about service for a restaurant but I must say that drunk idiots being stupid with the waitresses can normally end poorly but surprisingly this situation was handled with a very graceful manner. \\n\\nNow the food...

Dude, Foie Gras of the best quality, seared to perfection, on top of well cooked fries with cheese curd and a gravy that would taste good on a shoe. The gravy had an earthy quality that leads me to believe something other than regular beef base was in it, in a good way. Duck in a Can was what the food prior would lead you to think. It was amazing. The perfect blend of seasonings and herbs with a good mix of stewed vegetables. The duck was definitely fatty considering it is canned with a layer of fat over the duck breast and a considerable slab of foie gras but that only adds to the tenderness of the meat. served atop ... who cares the duck was outstandingly cooked and seasoned. Lamb shank was exceptionally prepared, not the most memorable choice but definitely good. \\n\\nDessert did not disappoint either. Pudding Choemer or whatever they call it. It's the maple sauce with a biscuit in it. A MUST HAVE!\\n\\nAll in all it was an excellent experience. The beer was great and the wine selection was very nice as well. I still can't get over how nicely the waitresses handled these clowns who were wasted. The price wasn't bad at all about $100 per person including tax and tip which included 3 beers, 2 glasses of wine, 3 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts plus a coffee and a cappucino.

The way they serve the seafood is usually with some sauce and let me tell you that the sauce or mixings they serve it with was wonderful.  The razor clam was chopped up and mixed into a salad.  Sea urchin was served in its own shell but with some sort of creme fraiche.  Conch was served with this mayo mixture.  Everything was awesome!\\n\\nFor other starters, we also had the bison tongue and the foie gras with bacon and maple syrup.  The bison tongue was very hearty and the tongue very tender.

      "('Wowzer! This food blew me away while anchoring me to my seat being so heavy and rich. \\nWent on Saturday night without reservation but flying solo so easily got a seat at the bar.  Did not realize til later that this place was brainchild of Martin Picard, same guy doing amazing things at M. Wells in NYC which I recommend you check out as well.\\nRound one was the fois gras poutine which everyone raves about. The experience was like swimming in a pool of fois GRAS  gravy with chunks of fois gras and cheese curds floating around you. Inhaled that bad boy without thinking that I had an entree coming...ugh.\\nRound two was the duck in a can which was pretty good. I actually enjoyed the vegetable and sauces that accompanied the duck more than the duck itself but it does not shave points off the oveall experience. \\nCome prepared with elastic pants or ready access to your top pants button.

      "('If you love the subtle, fatty taste of foie gras, you\\'ll love this place. We took advantage of their seafood season and ordered their PDC seafood platter replacing our previous choice for an appetizer, and added on the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. \\n\\nThe PDC seafood platter was impressive. There were around 25 pieces, and they weren\\'t just shucked oysters and clams, razor clams and snails on ice. They were treated in their own unique way. We had chopped clams with a beautiful apple, walnut, oil mixture. We had the most tender snail meat ever. We had maybe 6 pieces of shucked seafood, but they were treated with jelly or had a vinaigrette for us to enjoy with them. It was worth every penny and was deeeeelicious. It was a bit rich though to start the meal.\\n\\nThe foie gras poutine was probably the most \"disappointing\" of the three dishes if you could even call it that. The gravy was delicious but it overpowered the foie gras unless you really tried to identify the taste of the fatty liver. It would have been just as delicious had we just ordered the regular poutine or tried all the other famous places for poutine in Montreal.\\n\\nThe duck in a can was DIVINE. Beware though, only order this if you\\'re ready for a very fatty dish. The duck wasn\\'t melt in your mouth but the texture was done in that way to pair well with everything else in the can (foie gras and cabbage) that was cooked to a melting texture and taste. It was so rich and so fatty and yet I couldn\\'t stop eating it. The foie gras was succulent, soft, and paired incredibly well with the hearty duck. The cabbage was clearly greasy but it carried the flavor so well that you could very well overlook the richness of it and think it might be a healthy addition to the can\\'s contents. Btw the cabbage seems to also have been previously sauteed or braised with big chunks of bacon. I would definitely order this dish again and come back to try all the other dishes too.\\n\\nThe service here is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, informative, and quick. If your waters are even 1/3 of the way down, they\\'ll refill it. If you have dishes that are finished, they\\'ll take them away within a few minutes if you look like you\\'re ready to have them do so. You are seated reservations on the dot, rather than having to wait an additional 15 minutes after arrival. Everything here is a well-oiled machine.\\n\\nOur only surprise is that our waitress told us that most shirts (I know, we\\'re such tourists) were out of stock in Mediums, but the hostess nicely informed us that they had stock of everything. Might be a subtle way to let us know people wanted our seats? Or could have just been a mistake, doesn\\'t matter, we loved the food so much I didn\\'t dock the ratings for it.\\n\\nLet\\'s also say that for this quality and amount of food the prices are very reasonable. If you were put PDC in NY, these dishes would cost double, which makes me an even bigger lover of this restaurant! For special occasions, this place is a must. It\\'s not the most romantic of places, since everything is bustling, it\\'s somewhat noisy, so on. But it sure is a hell of a place to dine and watch them prepare foods if you\\'re sitting at or alongside the bar. Luckily we were sitting next to the fire oven and the seafood station so we enjoyed watching all three of the chefs busily preparing their dishes all night! I could have sat there for hours on end without having eaten it was that interesting.\\n\\nWe went in knowing that this was a famous restaurant but not expecting that this was the best in the world. With those levels of expectations what restaurant will ever pull it off? But if you go in there thinking that the food is supposed to be really good you\\'ll love it.', 5)\n",
      "(\"Our group of four was able to get an early dinner reservation. This place is booked far in advance and you can see why when you experience the food. \\n\\nFirst we got there and while walking through the dining area, the floors were extremely slippery.  The hostess actually warned us to be careful.  I guess with the open kitchen and the amount of cooking they do, the floor is hard to maintain. \\n\\nWe started with a seafood platter that blew my mind.  This is not typical seafood that's cleaned and thrown on a bed of ice.  The items in this platter were carefully prepared combinations of sauces to ingredients married together in tasty bliss.  There were cooked snails in sauce, mini sea snails, sea urchin in light foam sauce, oysters, and more.  I love how each piece was a creation in itself.  I would go back just to try the other seafood platters. \\n\\nOn the proteins.  Seared foie gras with a maple syrup sauce is to die for.  The syrup stands strong with the foie gras flavor and blends together nicely.  The duck in a can was a combination of the best parts of the duck (more foie gras) and duck breast, in a rich sauce.  We also had the pig's foot, which normally my wife would not like, but this one had so many flavors working with it that it's simply amazing.  Everything exceeded my expectations.  And I would go back to try the other stuff I didn't get to.  \\n\\nIf you're in Montreal, you must go. Book far in advance.\", 5)\n",
      "('This place is pretty pricey so I picked my birthday to come here. I was afraid it would be stuffy, but it actually seemed like a place you could go to every night (if you are loaded). The place has a robust and homey feelling atmosphere and the tables are not seated to close together so you can have a private conversation. There is lots of foie gras on the menu and also game. My bf had the bison ribs and it came out on a rib that must have been like 2 feet long. I had lamb shank which was very tasty. \\nI went to the bathroom, and there was a TV in there and lots of beer on ice. I asked what it was for and was told that it was so you could catch a bit of the hockey game, there was an important game on. You could lock yourself in there and sit and drink beer and watch the game - how great is that! Sort of a quirky idea, awesome. I was surprised there was no line.\\nThere seemed to be a lot of regulars, our waiter seemed to stop for little chats here and there.', 5)\n",

If you are on weight watchers you will spend a week\\'s worth of points (I calculated about 80 (or more) for the meal that we ate).\\n3. Those who take a political stance against the use of Foie Gras in any form\\n4. Those for religious reasons will not eat pork (actually there are other options, but you will be in the minority)\\n5. Anyone who is on a budget\\nI\\nOk, now down to business. I called the day before and got a reservation for the next night at 10:30PM.   We requested the bar and were seated directly in front of the open kitchen where the sauces were made and all dishes were finished before being set in the window to be expedited.  The atmosphere is animated and loud. The staff is attentive but not intrusive and we chatted with the chef\\'s occasionally because there were a few things we could not identify, they were very accommodating.  \\n\\nFirst up (besides the yummy bread and butter):  Salad (yes, I admit we were pretending to have a balanced meal, this was a farce in itself).  A smattering of lettuce and tomato tossed with a vinaigrette and topped off with lovely chunks of pork/fat bits (bacon?) and this lovely fried square of cartilage etc (tasted like hogs head cheese).  Not salty at all and a good way to \"ease on down the road.\"  At this point we are not bowled over but happy with what we were eating. \\n\\nNext, a server inquired...\"did you order the Foie Gras Cromesquis?\"  Qui! Our instructions: \"Please let this cool for 2 - 3 minutes and then put the whole cube in your mouth and bite but keep your mouth closed.\"  Ok, got it.  So out first comes the dish of Bone Marrow we ordered, cooked with a hint of maple and smeared with a luxurious dose of caviar.  This was declared better than sex by my dining companion (the chef laughed - I wasn\\'t sure I was going to make that kind of a substitution).  I can tell you this was creamier than any marrow I have ever tasted with the perfect balance of sweet and salt from the syrup and caviar.  Can you tell I am dreaming of this marrow?  In any event as we were savoring this delicacy the fried foie gras cubes emerge on a tiny wooden plate.  We want to dive right in but know that we have to wait the 2 - 3 minutes...no problem...plenty of time to really get into that bone marrow.  If we weren\\'t in public I would have grabbed that bone and licked it.  NOTE: Marrow is not for everyone.  It is almost like eating butter.  At this point we are ready for the foie gras cubes so we each popped one in our mouths.  It is completely liquid inside (I can just imagine how someone would be scalded who didn\\'t wait the prescribed 2 - 3 minutes for these babies to cool down!). Buttery, smoky, with a crunchy outside this was so delicious what a shame that you only get two in an order!  Simply beautiful.  At this point we were both grinning (while keeping the mouth closed!) and trying to prevent that taste from disappearing from our taste buds too fast.\\n\\nNext?  The famous Foie Gras Poutine.  I have had poutine elsewhere - it wasn\\'t bad - basically a highfalutin disco fry.  Neither one of us thought this dish would be anything special, um WRONG.  The fries were the perfect amount of crisp (well they better be, fried in duck fat), the chunks of foie gras and cheese curds sprinkled on top with 2 of the most amazing gravies poured over the top.  FYI, the gravy takes about 3 days to make! I just didn\\'t want this dish to end.  I also didn\\'t want to part with that gravy.  It was so rich it would have gone well with biscuits (instead of country gravy) or grits, fried chicken just about anything southern that you can conjure up.  Needless to say, I will only each poutine if Chef Martin Picard has something to do with the recipe.\\n\\nNext course was the Happy Pork Chop and the indubitable, Duck in a Can(Canard en Conserve).  The duck is quite flavorful but I mirror another person\\'s account - I don\\'t think it is their best item on the menu.  I think my Happy Pork Chop might be a contender though.  Looks like something out of the Flintstones with this huge rib bone sticking off the plate.  Perhaps this is a subliminal encouragement to just grab it with your hand and start gnawing away.  This ultra-tender chop was brimming over with mushrooms in a lovely burgundy gravy.  Both the duck and the pork have so many layers of flavor (and duck fat...) I was quite beside myself and ended up packing the remainder to take home.  We also ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side.  The mashed potatoes were filled with cheesy goodness.  This should be on everyone\\'s Christmas Dinner menu. We had just enough room for a light dessert of poached pear with vanilla ice cream.  The liquid from the pear was so delicious I wish I could have bottled it, added Prosecco and served it as a refreshing brunch drink.  \\n\\nGo Hungry.  Leave Happy!', 5)\n",

First, don't eat anything after your morning cafe and pain au chocolate, even if you can only get a 1030 reservation at the bar, THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE!

Whole roasted legs de cochon, on platters so large they required two servers to carry them out, tables full of visiting chefs happy to have gotten a reservation plenty of noise and amazing aromas and service as if they knew you by name.\\nFirst, the little molten foie gras cube, that despite repeated warnings, shot droplets through my closed lips and onto my napkin.  We ordered the pig's foot, (more like half a leg) and the canard conserve (canned duck), either one of which would have satisfied two diners and took our server's advice to have only half an order of the Poutine with Foie gras.  We decided after devouring it that it was the only bad advice we got!\\nWe could not possibly finish, so we packed away a beautiful picnic to take on our climb to the top of Mount Royal then next day, and moved on to dessert, a classic Quebecois maple pudding which came out bubbling hot from the oven.

Wow. \\n\\nWe should have left then, but decided to give it a shot and wait under an overhang down the street. 4 minutes later when we came back, we walked in to what looked like a very nice restaurant.

She said: \"oh, sorry we are booked tonight.\" Naturally, we laughed and looked around figuring she was joking. When her grimace failed to lighten we said \"Seriously?

      "('My boyfriend and I were in Montreal for Labor Day weekend.  We had actually decided on another spot for our \"big fancy\" dinner out but as it turns out, that restaurant was closed on Sunday nights.  As this place was also highly recommended to us, we trekked there.  Of course, halfway through the fifteen minute walk it starts torrentially pouring.  So when we arrived we\\'re pretty sopping wet and just ready to have a drink (but still in good enough spirits).  The look on the hostess\\'s face when we said we didn\\'t have reservation was priceless: this was certainly not a place to just pop into.  She did take pity on us though, and when a reservation at the bar was late she let us take the spot.  The bartenders that waited on us were incredibly nice and helpful in our selections ---even going so far to suggest we cut down our orders since our appetizers and such were larger and heavier than we were expecting.  My boyfriend and I split the ever-famous duck in a can and it was just as amazing as the hype would lead you to believe.  Definitely easy to split between two people, and we still didn\\'t finish it after splitting an appetizer and separate first courses.  (I\\'m a big fan of beef tartare and they have an amazing rendition of it) \\n\\nIt is pricey but worth every dime.  Great neighborhood as well for walking around and shopping.', 5)\n",
      "(\"This place is awesome!  Need a reservation weeks in advance, well worth it!  If you don't try the poutine au foie gras you are not doing yourself any favours!  It's crazy delicious.  I've also eaten the special of the day a couple times...trust this chef, he's good!!\", 5)\n",
      "(\"We ate here during a visit to Montreal this summer (August). Hating rejection, I e-mailed a week or so in advance for a reservation, and they phoned me back to confirm. After a day of hoofing it around the city, we walked right past this place twice since it doesn't have a sign. However, upon calling them for help we found it right there in plain sight. We were seated promptly and then sat there forsaken and forlorn for about ten minutes, my pet peeve. The reason for this was apparently that there was just one waitress for the front seating area and she took all the time needed to explain dishes and answer questions for each table, hence the wait. (Some self-absorbed diners love to inordinately monopolize servers with their inane queries instead of using the internet.) Anyhow, if you did your five minutes of homework, you know to order: pork and foie gras. We started with the delicious fried zucchini blossoms and a simple salad, then on to the stuffed pig's foot with foie. It was awesome, and awesomely rich. My wife, who is near-vegetarian, threw herself with gusto into disassembling this earthy, collagen-laden treat, served atop mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables and a thick demi-gravy. Whatever magical treatment they did there was absolutely no stink of cochon associated with this trotter, only yummy goodness. Yes, we did finish it, but there was no room for dessert. We had a French red the details of which now escape me. The place is pretty loud and tightly packed. I wouldn't call it comfortable, more down-to-the-business-of-eating, a money mill. A table of Asian tourists nearby provided diversion in the form of ordering and photographing endlessly an entire pig's head (served with a lobster as crown). Wish I had room for more!\", 5)\n",
      "(\"My favorite restaurant in North America. Every time we've been there we've been treated well and fed better. From the fois gras poutine to the duck in a can, and everything else, it's just cool.  And if you're lucky, Chef Picard will be there. It's fun to watch him work.\", 5)\n",

      "('Even Alan Richman has good words for this place so I consider this a must-try restaurant in Montreal. Our friends here told us how heavenly it is but also warned us it could be overly rich. We however, went against the advice and ordered a whole table of entrees with great ambition to conquer them all. \\n\\nWe started with the cod fish fritters to share. It somehow tasted like Chinese fish paste deep fried. The cod fish is grounded up with seasoning so it is nothing like a fish n chip if that is what you were thinking. It is crispy and tasty. \\n\\nThen we proceeded with PCD Crispy salad and it comes with a few lettuce but is laden with fried cartilage and crispy pork meat. The flavor and most importantly, fat makes the dish undeniable and delicious. We swept the whole dish within minutes. We also got an order of Bison Tongue and that is definitely the most delicious tongue I have ever encountered. I know tongue sounds frightening but in reality it is so tender and it soaked up all the sauces. We declared it a must try here. \\n\\nHere, we arrived at the most important moment of our meal at PCD. We patiently awaited the duck in a can. Then, the waiter brought us the famous can with cooked duck, gravy and fois gras over bed of bread and cheese. We watched him open the can and pour the wonder over the plate and we were astonished in awe. It was truly a magic plate. The duck breast was so tender and flavorful. The bread was soaked in the gravy within seconds and cheese melted to add more flavor. I had one piece and then another. \\n\\nThen, the 2nd entree arrived, the glorious \"Pied De Cochon\", aka pig knuckles or pig feet so to speak. Chinese love pig knuckles so I was excited to see how they prepare this dish. To my surprise, when the dish arrived I could not even see them. They were buried deeply underneath tons of cheese gravy sauce. The best part about pig knuckle is actually the skin and they cooked it right alright. It was chewy and tender at the same time. The meat is so tender and about to fall aprt. The sauce makes the dish so rich and delicious I think I reached my cholestrol capacity after two bites. \\n\\nI started to regret there is another entree coming. My stomach is already protesting. So we still have the blood sausage boutin tart left. I know we won\\'t even be able to finish them all. Then the dish arrived with pikes of cut blood sausage with again gravy on top of a buttery crust. I managed to try a small slice and declared I am done for the night. It was very good but I was not a big fan of blood sausage. But everyone really enjoyed the dish as well. \\n\\nI think for 4 people, 2 entrees will be plenty to share along with the appetizers. I will not be able to return for a long while so my stomach could get detox.', 5)\n",

I love thee pomme frittes.\\n3.  Pied De Cochon - of course we had to try the signature dish, or is that foe gras? Does it matter? The PDC had not only the pig foot but Foie gras as well. It was an experience and not bad at all. \\n4. The Duck in a Can - Ha!! We had to try it... the sauce was sublime, the duck tender and the Foie gras excellent. We overindulged, we sinned, and it was a beautiful thing.

Biggest piece of meat I\\'ve ever seen:) I loved it. Sauce on top was significiant & had a kick of spiciness too it too:) Side of fries were great too.

I couldn\\'t put my spoon down.

This place is completely meat oriented where even vegetables are meaty.\\n\\nI almost always choose to sit at the bar and order something with foie gras. Foie gras isn't something I eat often, but I always enjoy a well prepared piece and au Pied Cochon is one of the best places to experience this controversial product prepared to perfection.\\n\\nAu Pied de Cochon offers much more than foie gras and one of my favorite is the canard en conserve.

Don\\'t do what I did, it was stupid.  Make a reservation.  The wait at 8:30 on a Sunday was 2 and a half hours, not knowing where else to eat, I put my name and number on the list and went for a drive.  The Hostess called a half hour later and said some seats opened up at the bar and I hurried back.  \\n\\nThe restaurant has a glass windowed front dinning area, seats at the bar/kitchen in the middle and more seating in the back.  I\\'d suggest sitting at the bar if you can, that way you can watch the cooks at work.\\n\\nThe menu is in French but most, if not all, of the waitstaff can speak English and are very helpful.  The menu is broken down between apps, foie gras, entrees, and an assortment of meat dishes by category (poultry, pig, bison or deer).  Not knowing French, I opted for the dish named after the restaurant but we\\'ll get back to that.\\n\\nAPdC is known for their foie gras as is the rest of Montreal but the thing to order is the Poutine au foie gras.  It\\'s like an order of cheesy fries, but the cheese is foie gras.  It will blow your mind.  Also good, are the Cromesquis de foie gras which are fried balls of foie gras that you eat in one bite and explode in your mouth.\\n\\nBack to the entree - I ordered au pied de cochon and it was delicious.  It tasted like the dark meat of a turkey but so moist and fatty and this review just got dirty.  The fact is, I had no idea that what i was eating was pig\\'s feet and had I known what it was, I might not of but it was damn good and would recommend it.  It did come with mash potatoes as a side that were okay but the meat was the winner.  They finish the feet in the oven so the succulent meat is encased in crispy, fatty skin. YUM!\\n\\nNo room for dessert but I did have the namesake\\'s beer which was a nice and light beer to accompany the meal.  \\n\\nThis is a must go, if you are in Montreal for any period of time.  Parking is on the street and be sure to note the address.  I drove past the simple facade twice before I noticed the Pig above the entrance.\\n\\nNote: APdC is not open on Mondays as I found out when wanting to go back for seconds. \\n\\nEnjoy!', 5)\n",

He seemed genuine and took the time to talk to folks.  You don\\'t see that alot.', 5)\n",
      "(\"Simply incredible.  All around amazing.  The food was magnificent and the service truly top notch.  I was amazed at how the restaurant balanced being artful and gourmet with being genuinely welcoming and fun to its patrons.\\n\\nAmong other things we shared one of their specials for the night, pork shoulder with fiddleheads and gnocchi.  The texture and flavor were superb.  I could write about everything we ate with similar gushing adjectives, but I'll spare you.\\n\\nOverall, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.\", 5)\n",
      "('One of the worst dining experience of my entire life.\\n\\nWe were a group of 4 people with a reservation at 930pm, called in a month in advance. We arrive there at 915, and the hostess tells us that we\\'re early and to wait outside. She says that she will come get us when our table is ready. So we go outside and wait. 9:30pm passes and 9:45pm comes, and we\\'re wondering if she forgot about us. So I go inside and ask if our table is ready, and the hostess says 5 more minutes, they are clearing our table. Knowing that this is a busy restaurant, I give them some room and return outside to wait.\\n\\nDuring that time, other groups of 4 people who arrive after us are getting seated. I go back to talk to the hostess and ask what\\'s going on, and she replies that these people arrived before us so they had priority??? So you\\'re telling us we\\'re early when we arrive at 9:15pm, then tell us that people who arrive after us are getting priority??? By that time, we just wanted to leave, but because we heard so many great things about au Pied de Cochon, we decided that we wanted to try the food anyways.\\n\\nSo by that time, its around 9:55pm and we\\'re still waiting outside. The hostess comes back outside and says that unfortunately our table is still not ready because the current occupants \"just started dessert\". WHY DID YOU TELL US at 9:45pm that our table was getting cleared and would be ready in 5 minutes?? She apologized and gave us free beers, which we really didn\\'t care about. We were hungry and wanted to eat. Also because we had beers in our hands, we had to wait inside in the hallway, which is super tiny with lots of people trying to get in and out. While standing in the hall, I get to see the reservation list and see that all people who had a reservation at 930p had been crossed out( which means seated) except us, and people from 10pm had been crossed out too. What is going on here?\\n\\nWe finally get seated at 10:15pm (a whole 45 minutes after our reservation), and we\\'re all mad and starving. The waitress comes and finally gets our order, and we finally think that our troubles will be over, and that we\\'re ready to drink and eat. One of the waiter brings over a plate of cod fritters that one of us ordered, and clumsily drops 2 fritters on the table while trying to set the plate down. Instead of offering to replace them, he simply mumbles \"Oh sorry\" then leaves. EXCUSE ME? Is this real? One of my friend is livid and starts to yell, and our original waitress comes by and asks if everything\\'s all right. My friend explains to her what happened and she offers to replace them at free of charge ( a big 6$ in comped food right there). \\n\\nAlso, when she took our order, one of us ordered a pale ale and she completely forgets about it. We had to remind her, and she says nobody ordered it from her. After telling her again that we ordered it, she says: oh yeah I forgot and then brings the beer 20 minutes after it was ordered. Is this serious?\\n\\nThey finally bring us the food:\\n\\nAppetizer\\nFoie gras poutine: Awesome. I can see why au pied de cochon became famous because of this plate. The fries are perfectly cooked, the cheese is chewy and tasty, the sauce is incredibly flavorful, and the foie gras just adds to the richness of the plate\\n\\n(For some reason, they brought us bread after we finished the poutine. I thought bread was supposed to be served at the beginning of the meal...)\\n\\nMain dishes:\\n\\nFoie gras hamburger: Very average. The foie gras itself is bigger than the meat patty which isn\\'t that big to begin with, and overpowers the entire burger\\n\\nDuck in a can: Good, but doesn\\'t come close to being as good as advertised. There\\'s an overload of cabbage in the dish, and the duck meat is undercooked\\n\\nMagret de canard: Bland, nothing special. Friend who took this commented on the lack of any flavors.\\n\\nPieds de cochon with foie gras: Mixture of fatty pieces of pig feet with sauce. There is no way anybody could take more than 4 bites of this without being sick of the richness of this dish. \\n\\nAfter we finished our meal, we were all fed up with this experience. We just paid and left with a very bitter taste.\\n\\nOverall, I was very disappoointed with Au pied de cochon. Having driven all the way from Philadelphia to Montreal, and having heard many great things about this restaurant from food critics to friends and family, I had very high expectations for this. The horrible customer service just overpowers any potential to have an acceptable dining experience here. The food is ok. I understand the concept of this restaurant which is fat/richness/heavy food on top of fat/richness/heavy food, but there are so many better options out there in a great foodie city like Montreal. \\n\\nI will NEVER EVER come back here again', 1)\n",
      "(\"By reading and asking around, we got APDC recommended, so I made a reservation. We expected a great night out with marvelous food, but no! Everything they served was greasy and fat. My husband and my father ordered the pork tenderloin, which needed to be prepared for an hour? And it was such a setback! Only a big piece of meat on your plate. Red cabbage was drown in the grease, horrible! They took three bites and didn't finished it.  I had the salmon, which wasn't great either and my mom had happy pork chop, was ok. For these prices, we eat in Manhattan a great dish! \\n\\nAlso the people next to us gave back their food, not a good sign.\\n\\nDon't go here!! There are so many other great restaurants you can go.\", 1)\n",
      "(\"APDC is now on top of my favourite restaurant list! No wonder why it is so hard to get a reservation there. Ambience was fun and lively, and the food was just remarkable. My husband and I shared a Foie Gras Poutine (A MUST!!!!), duck carpaccio (YUMMMM!!), truffle omelette (nothing special), pig feet (wasn't so good, a little too rich, didn't finish it) and magret de canard (A BIG MUST!!!!!) We couldn't stop saying to each other how good the food was. Loved how we can watch the staff working in the open kitchen and absorb some of the great energy and passion that they shared in their food. Price is a little on high, but absolutely worth it. I will definitely recommend this place to everybody! Can't wait for my next visit!\", 5)\n",

      "('A total disappointment. My grandson and I  were  in Montreal for the f1 weekend. Prior to our trip we reaserched on yelp for recommendations.  This resturant was highly rated, therefore, we decided to reserve for our first night.   The food was covered with greasy sauce and it looked and tasted horrible.  It was a waist of a dinner. The only good thing to eat their was the bread and butter.', 1)\n",
      "(\"After all the rave reviews about this place that I read, I found it thoroughly disappointing. The service was fine, but the restaurant itself was noisy and crowded. I had a foie gras appetizer and the bison tartare, but neither was anything special and the tartare was too heavy on capers. The food was expensive and just wasn't the good. After all the hype and waiting until 9pm just to get a table, I was expecting a dining experience and instead got just a meal.\", 1)\n",

      "('The sinister mind that has the evilness to encompass the creativity of such a menu has the capacity of making the sun itself burn with envy. Chef Martin Picard brings classic Quebecois country style cooking to the city; not reinventing but more reintroducing urbanites to the wonders of pudding chomeur and Jesus ears. I suggest eating salad for breakfast and lunch on the day of your reservation... caloric intake will be equal to at least two days.', 5)\n",
      "(\"Another montreal rec from katie j. We e-mailed them a month prior and got a reservation for 7:30pm on a Tuesday night.

We were seated at a table by the floor to ceiling windows which were left open due to the lovely weather.\\n\\nThe food was amazing - rich and flavorful. I'd especially recommend the bison tongue (wonderfully tender texture) and the duck in a can (rich, but don't be afraid to try it!). The foie gras poutine was too much for me, but hubby loved the seared foie gras. The wine recommendations from the waiter were spot on. \\n\\nWe were too full for dessert, but if we're ever in Montreal again, we'll be back!\", 5)\n",
      "('I\\'ll let you in on a secret: I\\'ve been a fan of pork (most notably, its smoked offspring, bacon) long before \"bacon in everything!\" became a popular rallying cry.  Illustrative example: a lunchtime treat in middle school was a peanut butter and bacon sandwich.  No foolin\\'.\\n\\nSo, when I moved to Montreal and heard of a restaurant named in honour of the pig...I was in.  Even before I read all of the glowing reviews, heard buzz for its owner Martin Picard, and tasted the amazing food for myself.\\n\\nAnd...amazing it is.  Au Pied de Cochon became my standard choice for \"parents in town\" dinners.  I\\'ve eaten my way through the menu from delicate fried zucchini blossoms to heavy foie gras-topped poutine (the restaurant not-so-subtly enforces a go big or go home approach).  \\n\\nFor all of the heaviness (long braises, dark sauces, rich meats), however, Au Pied de Cochon is able to be delicate with its flavours and textures, too.  Perfectly fried ittle cubes (cromesquis) explode in your mouth, taste buds fist pumping with excitement.  Summertime brings the option of a seafood tower to the menu, with locally sourced options plated in an amazing vertical display.  Lemon, berries, fresh herbs and local vegetables: this restaurant\\'s focus is not just a tribute to the pig, but to the bounty of Quebec.  \\n\\nThe space is beautiful, the staff is amazing, the vibe is happy and bubbly and celebratory (as it should be: I challenge you to leave this place with anything but a smile on your face).\\n\\nTwo quick anecdotes:\\n\\nUn: once, I stayed until after close, finishing some drinks.  At end of service I saw the staff congregate by the bar to take final \"we did it, gang!\" shots.  That comraderie was not only special to witness, but is truly evident in how the staff runs service.  It\\'s not a formal vibe, but the front and the back of the house runs like a well-oiled machine.\\n\\nDeux: a friend was having an engagement dinner at Au Pied de Cochon.  I was unfortunately unable to make it, so I called in advance to ask if they could do something special for the table in my absence.  Not only were they happy to get in on the surprise, but they presented all those arriving with champagne, charging me very fairly (and, by Toronto standards, far less than market price).  \\n\\nYelp note: Go.  Here.  Hungry.', 5)\n",
      "('After four or five visits I summarize that PDC is a five star experience with 4 star food.\\nEverything is mostly super not superb , but, you are going to have the quintessential foodie experience here.   M. Picard has put it all together in this Montreal must go place. The elements of greatness are:  an unusual and super creative menu.cool and casual atmosphere and an extremely high level of service. If you are reading this you probably already know about the ultra \"rich\" food. Most of the menu items involved some unique amalgam of pork, fois gras - hello California come to Montreal -and duck. If you want you can even eat healthy with nice roasted sea foods and salads. During the summer months there is also a fresh seafood \"bar\" offering  extravagant selections. Our most recent choices for our a table of six were mostly the standard PDC items with the Pig\\'s foot swimming in gravy just OK, the duck magret very good and the standout this time the Ploque a Champlain, a crepe like pork and fois gras combination.\\n\\nPDC is a foodie mecca and is most always crowded with a well healed clientele ready to drop a few hundred bucks if need be to experience this place. On a hot summer night this past June the place was still rock\\'n after 11pm and we saw a few celebs at a nearby table. The staff were apologetically late with our table, we had to wait almost 45 minutes after the reserved time to be seated, but they made up for the inconvenience by leading a few of our party to the bar and providing some nice wine and an appetizer plate gratis. Very classy and unexpected. \\nThe servers were friendly,extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and were of the highest calibre which adds so much to the overall experience. The wine offerings were extensive and expensive, but, we managed to find some nice bottles in the mid $40 range and our party managed to knock off four or five bottles.\\n\\nSo for all you Yelpaholic restaurant ,mavens, officiandos,doyens like me,this is the kind of place that we live for !', 5)\n",
      "('Oh Montreal... how to sum you up food wise. Eat as much as you can, purge so you can eat some more. If I could I would spend as much money as I could at this restaurant, Au Pied de Cochon. An incredibly famous eatery to those who are foodies, it is the devilish child of the ridiculously insane chef Martin Picard. This restaurant, like many others I have reviewed, can be summed up as a vegan nightmare. A menu completely in French and relatively unfriendly to vegetarians, if you are a carnivore looking for something more, come to this restaurant. Moreover, don\\'t take a skinny girl here. Okay, that\\'s a bit much but don\\'t take a girl here who is expecting to \"eat light.\" That\\'s the stupidest thing you can do.\\nLocated on a little street somewhere in the middle of Montreal off of St. Denis, this restaurant as my friend mentioned \"doesn\\'t even need a sign.\" It is that popular. Rated as one of the best restaurants in a foodie city like Montreal, you better expect to see your respective religious deity when you bite into this food. So let\\'s just say my standards were high. I mean, pole vaulting high. \\nAdvice: reserve a table. If you\\'re planning on going or just thinking about going reserve a table, now. The place doesn\\'t seat many people and it has a notorious reputation for being a fantastic restaurant so, yes, reservations are heavily advised. \\n\\nOff of the nitty gritty details and onto the food. If you want to read about this experience feel free. If you\\'re looking for whether or not you should go? Yes. Just go. But be warned, you will spend a lot of money and then you will want to go back to spend more. \\n\\nMy friend and I started off with a veal bone marrow with caviar, served with a slice of bread in some sweet nectar of the gods. Now, I\\'m a fan of bone marrow and for those of you who are cringing at the thought of it. I shake my head at your sad sad life without the joys of trying the buttery, mouth-watering substance. It is, if cooked properly (and yes it was cooked beyond properly here) it is divine. The slice of bread it came with was toasted with what seemed to be honey and the caviar gave an amazing little bitterness but the bone marrow... I\\'m salivating just remembering it. The entire combination of the bone marrow, caviar, and sweet slice of bread was mind-bogglingly good; the epitome of artistic creation and the love of food in one entr\\\\u00e9e (appetizer if you\\'re American). My friend and I scooped as much of the marrow out as we could, like @$*%ing vampires. \\nMy main was, naturally, pork. With a title like Au Pied de Cochon, I had to try their \"cochon\" (pig for non-French speakers). I decided on their La Coupe, or cut of tenderloin. I don\\'t know what it was exactly, but it was big, covered in an onion, mushroom, and (I think) red wine reduction and made me realize why food is one of life\\'s initial pleasures. From what I understand, it is incredibly difficult to bake pork without it getting dry. I must admit, my pork was a bit drier than I would\\'ve preferred but hell, it was 0.5 kg of meat. That\\'s over 1 lb of piggy pleasure. Now I\\'m not skinny, but I\\'m not enormous, I\\'m also 5\\'1 and I managed to eat the majority of my main. PRIMARILY because it was just so damn good. The one thing is, if you order this there is a 45 minute wait but in my opinion it is well worth it.\\nNow my friend ordered the Foie Gras Hamburger (again, vegan nightmare), which was what I really wanted to try. Hesitantly, he let me try his rather expensive dish, and when I had it the foie gras melted. Despite being a near impossible burger to hold, it was fatty and delicious, and heart-stoppingly (in a good way) delectable. \\n\\nIn the end, when it came to dessert we couldn\\'t fit another bite. I remember sitting there watching the cooks work, my friend (a chef) pointed out each task each person did. As an open kitchen you can see these men prepare your meal for you right there. As someone who has never been but has read about the food industry, this kitchen, the restaurant works like a restaurant should and serves food like most restaurants should. Despite the high quality of food, it doesn\\'t have the snooty attitude that usually is associated with fine dining. The men in the kitchen are all tattooed, the waiters are in t-shirts. It looks like your average restaurant but it is so much more than that. If you are like me and enjoy the restaurant world and can appreciate it from the outside, I insist you come to Au Pied de Cochon. Watch the high octane but fluid movements of the cooks and take a piece of what you can out from your experience. \\n\\nAll in all, I will be going back, no doubt. From this essay of a review, Au Pied de Cochon is in a class of it\\'s own with an atmosphere of its own. The food, though heavy, is amazing. If people knew about the chef who started this restaurant, they would understand the menu better. In essence, M. Picard is saying \"Go big or Go Home.\" Go. It is worth the money you\\'ll spend.', 5)\n",
