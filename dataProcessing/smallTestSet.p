p800
tp801
a(g777
I12
S'oh, and they also have these "grilled footlong hot dogs," but beware - they aren\'t your ordinary hot dogs, they\'re more like these enormous sausages & they\'re rather oily/greasy...not for the faint of heart (and the reason they\'re like five/six bucks or something like that).'
p802
tp803
a(g777
